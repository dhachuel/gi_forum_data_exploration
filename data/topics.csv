0,"What has helped me for more than two years with almost daily attacks of diarrhea is calcium in the form of Caltrate Plus. Calcium is known to be constipating so if you suffer from constipation-type IBS do not take it. Here is the what and how to take the calcium information if you suffer from diarrhea.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Calcium is an over the counter supplement we all do not usually get enough of. No prescription needed to purchase this. When you take calcium about 40 per cent of the dose gets to the bones, the rest is eliminated in our waste. The calcium goes to the intestines and soaks up excess fluids and binds them together and they are gotten rid of in our waste.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));This is a process that can be continued by taking the calcium carbonate on a regular basis thus giving a more formed bowel movement. There is calcium carbonate which helps us with diarrhea and there is calcium citrate which is more easily absorbed by the body and gets to the bones.A lot of the calcium supplements contain a 2 to 1 ratio of calcium to magnesium. Magnesium is not helpful for us with diarrhea only causing more in most cases. So do not purchase this combination. It will only make things worse. The dose to take is different for everyone. I must take three a day one at each meal and it does not make a difference if I take it before, during or after: just take it regularly.The most success has come from using any formula of calcium supplement that is like Caltrate 600 Plus with Vitamin D and Minerals, in the purple and white box. I hope this will help anyone wishing to try it. There are other things to consider. If you take any other meds check the side effects and also check with the pharmacist to see if taking calcium will interfere with your other medications and how you might take them. The only side effect is at the beginning of taking the calcium you may have some gas or indigestion but this usually goes away soon after taking a regular dose for a few days, as your body adjusts to the added calcium.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Starting with 1/2 tablet doses with each meal will lessen this problem and it may be enough to control the diarrhea attacks without making you constipated. Constipation can be a problem so be careful not to take too much.I had my gallbladder removed in 1976 and from that time on I had suffered urgent attacks of diarrhea. Went through a lot of test but nothing else could be found. I took many of the meds for bowel spasms and cramps over the years but nothing ever seemed to help. I started to take a calcium supplement to help  prevent bone loss in later years and from the first day I felt relief. I was pretty much a prisoner to the bathroom or had to go without eating to be able to leave the house. I must take one tablet with each meal and the diarrhea does not come back. If I miss taking it I get diarrhea.The way it works is the calcium carbonate it a binder and when you take it only about 40 per cent of the calcium gets to the bones and the rest is gotten rid of in our waste. During the process it gets to the intestines and soaks up excess bile and water and helps give a more solid BM. Now that you have no gallbladder the bile fluid goes directly into the intestines and causes irritation and diarrhea. The calcium carbonate soaks this up and no more diarrhea. It works great for a lot of us and you just have to take the calcium regularly and do not miss.I started with Caltrate 600 and it does seem to make a difference in the ingredients of calcium...This one seems to do the best job for most. You can buy other store brands of calcium with the same ingredients that work just as well but they need to have the same ingredients. I get Member's Mark Brand from Sam's Club you get 300 tablets for 8.99.You won't be sorry if you try it. I suggest starting with half a tablet with each meal at first this may be enough to control the diarrhea if not in a 
few days up the dose to 1 tablet with each meal. The side effect is constipation so if you feel it coming on just cut the dose. It is important to use a calcium that is as much alike as the Caltrate brand. Let me list the ingredients:vitamin D 200iucalcium 500 or 600mg (this should be calcium carbonate form)magnesium 40mg (no more than this amount because magnesium will cause you to have diarrhea but because calcium is constipating the magnesium helps to counteract that effect)zinc 7.5mgcopper 1mgmanganese 1.8mgboron 250 mcgThere are other brands with the same ingredients so get something as close as you can. Then start with half a tablet with each meal and in a few days if this is not enough to control your diarrhea then up the dose to one tablet with each meal. If you feel you are becoming constipated then cut back on the dose.It has been working since the first day I started taking it July 1998 and as long as I take three a day (this is the amount I must take it may be 
different for you) I remain diarrhea-free. No cramps, bloating or diarrhea. The dose you take with each meal is not the dose that is helping you at that meal, it is the prior ones that have time to work their way through your system to soak up excess bile and water in the intestines. It also works for those of you who still have the gallbladder. It is worth a try and some Lotronex users are getting some help with the calcium.",P,calcium,meal,side effect,pill,tablet,tablet,carbonate,magnesium,bone,attack
1,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I'm Jenny and I'm 36. I've suffered with IBS for about seven years. I first became ill when I was going out with my previous boyfriend (still haven't worked out if he was the cause!). We eventually split up after six years.I had various test done through the hospital, but nothing was found, the consultant eventually told me that I had IBS, it was basically all in my 
mind and I should go away and have a baby as this would take my mind off myself and therefore, my IBS would heal! I didn't take him up on his 
advice!I was at the end of my tether and was seriously considering the best way to commit suicide. Then, a woman I vaguely knew in work cornered me one day and asked me why I had so much time off work. I tried to avoid answering, as I had lost so many friends by this time, I didn't really trust anyone, but she persisted and I eventually told her everything.She gave me a card with the name and address of a nutritional therapist. I decided to try her and put my suicide plans on the back burner. The woman who gave me the card is now one of my best friends. I went to the nutritional therapist and she basically 'saved' my life. She  understood completely and after various tests and chats, I found out that I suffer from severe food allergies and intolerances. She put me on a very strict diet with supplements (this was five years ago).I have to say that this has not cured me as I still get attacks (my symptoms are the severe runs, extreme bloating, severe wind, overwhelming tiredness and occasional nausea), but my attacks now are mostly stress-related and I try to keep calm as much as I can. This can prove to be difficult as I work for social security and I find that my employers are not the most sympathetic to work for...they don't understand! Plus I'm threatened with the sack on regular occasions.As my IBS improved, so did my life, I found that I was able to go out again, without worrying too much of having an attack. I met new friends, some of which suffer with varying degrees of IBS, this helps as we compare symptoms and sometimes even laugh about them.The best of all, three years ago I met Nigel, he knew nothing of my condition and on our first date didn't comment that I only drank mineral 
water. During our second date we ended up at his house at a meal time, I couldn't not eat! He made no comment when I asked him for boiled rice, broccoli and a glass of mineral water, he even had some boiled rice in his soup!I eventually had to tell him of my illness and he rushed off to get pen and paper, he wrote down everything I could eat. When I next visited him he showed me a cupboard in the kitchen, he'd filled it with all the food that I could eat...I was totally overwhelmed, no-one had ever understood before, especially a man!Needless to say, we now live together with my IBS and we're getting married in June. None of this has made my IBS improve, I seem to have hit a level and don't feel that it will improve much more, but most of the time it's bearable and I'm very happy with my life.E-mail Jenny:[email protected]",N,attack,attack,attack,friend,attack,mineral water,exam,email,rice,rice
2,"I have suffered for a number of years from what the doctors have diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. My IBS came on very suddenly, one evening, with severe abdominal pain. The pain was so intense that I began to hyperventilate. My husband rushed me to the hospital where the doctors could find nothing wrong with me. They gave me morphine for the pain and sent me home.The next day I felt fine and so dismissed this as a one-time incident. Within a month I experienced the pain again, although not as severe, but it stayed with me for about four days. For the next several months I went through this suffering for four days to a week and then feeling good for two to three weeks, and then again four days to a week of pain.I made several visits to different doctors, each one diagnosing IBS and suggesting eliminating the foods that cause pain, getting more exercise, and eliminating stress. They prescribed painkillers and muscle relaxants and sent me home feeling hopeless. The painkillers caused drowsiness and constipation, and the muscle relaxants caused my heart to race. I knew that I couldn't continue to use them, but really didn't want to anyway.I wanted to find a natural way to combat this affliction. I took the doctors' advice and began walking to get my exercise. This seemed to help 
considerably but I was unable to do it when in pain, as it made the pain much worse. I also eliminated the foods that seemed to bother me. Foods such as cabbage, broccoli, corn, soda pop, and ice cream.I began taking acidophilus, a glass of prune juice every morning, and a calcium supplement, these all seemed to help relieve the pain to some degree but not enough.The stress elimination was not as easy and I am still working on that. I also tried many fiber supplements which hurt more than helped and I had to quit trying them. In the meantime the episodes were happening more often and lasting longer, although the pain was not as severe as it had been.It soon became a mental problem of being afraid to eat because almost everything that I consumed would cause pain and bloating. I began to feel nauseated almost every time that I ate and I quickly lost 25 pounds. By this time my episodes were so frequent that once I had recovered from one, because they left me so drained and tired, it took several days to a week to recover after the pain, then I would have another. I was getting scared, extremely tired, and desperate to find relief.In my search I happened upon a story of a man that was to the point of vomiting nearly everything that he ate and had lost 45 pounds. He had discovered a digestive enzyme with acidophilus and within three days of taking it with every meal he had improved to the point of being able to eat almost anything he wanted without a problem. I tried it and also found significant relief within three days.I have since gained back the 25 pounds and do not feel nauseated at all. I am not afraid to eat now but find that I still cannot eat very much of either the refined sugar products nor the high fiber vegetables. I have continued the digestive enzyme, acidophilus, the prune juice and the 
exercising, and I have also added a cup or two per day of peppermint and chamomile tea.When I do have an episode it occurs late in the day and by the next morning I am feeling back to normal. I can now concentrate more on exercising, eating well and relieving stress.Unfortunately I cannot tell you that if you have IBS and you do all of the things that I have done that it will relieve your symptoms. I can tell you that when your life is enveloped by this horrible thing called IBS it is definitely worth trying anything that is suggested to you. Finding what will 
relieve your symptoms is a trial an error process, as one thing can help some people and will hurt others. The secret is to not give up hope and to 
keep trying.",NEU,pain,doctor,doctor,sugar product,ice cream,pound,food,stress,pound sterling,home
3,"I was first diagnosed with IBS after drinking coke down the pub. I had been having really bad stomach pains and all the other symptoms of IBS so I decided to stop drinking alcohol as I thought it would be bad for me. So I had a pint of coke and it must have been the worst pain I have ever experienced.I collapsed on the floor in agony and I was rushed to hospital. It took them a while and then they finally told me it was IBS. I knew what this was as one of my friends was a bad sufferer but I couldn't believe I had it! I blamed it on stress and food intolerances.After a trial and error period I worked out what affected me and what didn't so I now can't eat normal bread, chocolate and pasta. But I was still getting pains when I worked out it was college - it was so stressful.I was getting up at 6am to get the bus to get into college for 9am and then having about eight lessons a day with no breaks, and not getting home until 8.00 some evenings! It was a nightmare and I completely failed the first year so I moved to a nearer college and am now very happy!

4,"Firstly I must say, what a relief to find this website. I was diagnosed with having IBS four years ago and I thought I was becoming a food freak! The doctors told me about the physical aspects of having IBS, but not once do I remember them saying 'You'll go partially insane through constantly thinking about going to the loo!' And believe me at the age of 22, trying to complete a degree in teaching, you have enough to worry about.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Like most IBS sufferers I have cut out food such as bread, pasta and chocolate (hard when your parents own a sweet shop) but for me personally I find the strain it has on your social and working life more of a challenge than the physical aspect.At university I would not be concentrating on the lectures but trying to plan how I could leave the lecture hall if I suddenly needed the toilet. Whilst on teaching practice I would be counting the minutes to when I could next visit the ladies room. Believe me the mental strain to keep going was unbelievable. There is a happy ending (well sort of - there are no miracle cures). I finished my degree and am planning to start teaching soon.",P,food,conference,happy end,kind,website,kind,lady,toilet,room,hall
5,"eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));My IBS started when I changed jobs. I am in my mid-20s, and when I say I changed jobs, I actually mean I changed jobs and moved 200 
miles north at the same time. I didn't have any time off for the move and my first week of work was awful, every time I went into a meeting room with someone for an introductory chat, my stomach would make growling noises and I was in so much pain.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));My stomach kept swelling up like a football. Immediately after eating I would feel like I was going to have diarrhea and when I got to the toilet I would be constipated. Often I had to run trying not to break wind. It was awful. Every time I got up to collect something from the printer or do photocopying I had to pretend to look at my watch while the sensation passed before I could carry on walking.This carried on for months, so eventually I went to my doctor. I was so embarrassed to tell him I was flatulent all the time, and I couldn't think of an appropriate word for it at the time either! He said it was IBS and it was often stress-related, and suggested my change of job was to blame.Since then I have found this website  really helpful, and I realize that my constant toilet trips (at work I am known for going every hour on the hour) and pain is nothing compared to some of the stories I have read. I have found the oddest things set me off, namely pineapple juice, yogurt, alcohol,  bananas and biscuits to name a few...I know this sounds really obvious, but near to my period it gets really bad, so I never do the top button of my trousers up and try to wear as 
loose-fitting trousers as possible, that really seems to help the pain and swelling. And I try to eat well, but sometimes when the IBS gets me down, all I want to do is eat cake and chocolate.Work is definitely the hardest thing for me. My team mates joke about the fact I always seem to know where free toilets are in all major cities in Britain - but for me this essential when going out (finding money wastes valuable time). My doctor put me on tablets to aid my weight loss and the side effects were oily stools and the need to got to the toilet urgently - great.Going to the toilets at work has become a bit of a trauma, I am obsessed about the cubicles being empty in case I have some sort of explosion (I'm not kidding!). I hope that nevertheless this is a happy story because knowing what my problem is and learning to cope is positive for me. I also appreciate that my symptoms are not as bad as they could be. I hope that those still suffering find things to help them soon.Worst moment: Breaking wind in a restaurant when a child decided to tickle me. Either that or breaking wind in front of my manager.

6,"I fortunately have a success story. It is so wonderful to be free of all that pain and bloating. I, like others on this site, suffered constantly 
from age 17 to 27. Sometimes day in and day out for weeks straight, sometimes it would come for a day and then not be back for a month. I know too well how it feels to have to get to the bathroom and go through those cold sweats. Pepto-Bismol and Rolaids were my best friends.I nearly had surgery on my appendix because the doctors thought it was about to burst, the doctors even had me call my mom. Luckily the pain subsided a few hours later and I was sent home. I hadn't been diagnosed with IBS yet, so started worrying about my appendix. The stress! That made it worse and brought on my worst bout of IBS.I coached gymnastics at the time, and at work I would often have to lay on the mat with my legs up, and coach from that position through clenched teeth. Such a nightmare. That's when a doctor diagnosed me with IBS and recommended Metamucil, fruits and vegetables and plenty of water.I couldn't stomach the Metamucil drink so tried the wafers which I thought tasted pretty good, like graham crackers, but they didn't get rid of my stomach problems. The water and fruits had been in my diet, so there went that. I began a diet similar to slim fast, I won't name it, but it consisted of a soy drink high in protein and vitamins.I would eat a protein bar, fruit or vegetable for snacks between meals, and one full meal, usually; chicken, baked potato, vegetables and dessert (most of the time it was vanilla ice cream). I also upped my water to 10 to 12 glasses a day (since it flushes out fat, and the goal was to lose weight).In less than a month, all of my symptoms were gone! I continued this diet for a little over two years. I lost a ton of weight, which I've gained back, but I'm now 32 and haven't suffered from IBS for five years! I know what you're going through.

7,"Hi there. I was diagnosed with IBS about two years ago when I was about 20. But the truth is I've had symptoms of IBS for years before that. My worst symptom is diarrhea. I'm lucky that I haven't really had any awfully embarrassing incidents.I'm usually very lucky and manage to find a bathroom fast enough. But that's usually less luck and more planning on my part. I've managed to learn the art of scoping out all the bathrooms within a few minutes of stepping in to any situation.Aisle seats, sit close to bathrooms at restaurants, and never get trapped in a booth. It gets pretty stressful at times trying to always find 
an escape route. But I've gotten used to it. As far as getting better, I've made a number of changes to my diet. I've eliminated milk and mostly any dairy, fried foods, sugar for the most part, pop, alcohol, potato chips, spicy food, rice, pasta and bread. Most recently I'm eliminating flour. And I've actually just added soy milk and bran to my morning routine. I thought I'd give it a try.But my best friend for the last couple of years has been Imodium  tablets! I don't ever leave home without them. I've got packs in my car, my purse, my jacket. I just have to make sure I don't overdo it. If I ever become immune to the wonder drug I am going to be a real mess!I guess the hardest thing about IBS for me is being afraid to go out, all the planning that goes into everything I do. Leaving the house is always really scary. Not knowing when I might suddenly need a bathroom. I think part of the problem is as soon as I am on my way out I start second-guessing myself and get all tense. That in turn brings on the diarrhea. I just know that I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this. I'm 22, I want to get married, have kids!Anyways good luck to all the sufferers out there. There is hope, we all just have to keep giving our feedback and sharing what is working for us. And I am so glad to see so many great boards and IBS help sites online.

Then about two years ago I began experiencing some very strange symptoms.

feeling like I was dying anyway. People treat you differently when they know that IBS is something that isn't 'serious' as in life-threatening, but as my gastroenterologist told me that he could treat the pain of his colon cancer patients better than the IBS patients.So we have to endure serious and life-altering pain, without the empathy we would have if what we have was terminal. Sort of ironic in a way...how many times have we all heard 'Well, at least it's not serious and you don't die from it!' You feel badly for those who do die from diseases, but yet from all the pain and embarrassment you wish you could die...such a dichotomy. That's how I felt anyway...Well, I was officially diagnosed in 1988, after about five years of not knowing why I was having increasing severe diarrhea and abdominal pain. With the birth of my daughter that same year, I thought I better get tested, that maybe I did have some digestive disease, but several colonoscopies later, it was confirmed as IBS. Trips to the Mayo Clinic and two other gastros further confirmed that every single prescription and OTC medication had little or no effect, and only short-term, if any.My gastro finally told me that he had exhausted his treatment options, and to go look up other treatments on the internet. In my search, through the IBS Group Bulletin Board, and my friend there, I found out about the use of clinical hypnotherapy for IBS, which worked for him, but in my opinion, I thought was pretty far-fetched and seemed to be absurd to me.But I was desperate and he told me to try it, so I did as a last resort in the summer of 2000. This was the IBS Audio Program, which is a set of CDs with a specific schedule of several sessions that you listen to. That was over three years ago, and now I can actually leave the house, whereas before, I raised my children 'through the bathroom door!' I had attacks of diarrhea and pain lasting for hours on end, sometimes six hours a day, almost every day, never knowing when...even if I ate small amounts, the attacks would come out of the blue.My IBS cost me a whole lost life...events and special celebrations for my kids, just taking them to routine doctor and dentist appointments was an ordeal, and my marriage suffered and collapsed in part because of it. I went from being able to travel and talk professionally in front of large groups of people, to being just about housebound.This program saved my life. I now have a life!

14,"I first started with IBS seven years ago with constipation, massive bloating, and discomfort. It was caused by the stress of my mum's death and my son's diagnosis of autism within a very short space of time.However in January this year my bowel habit completely altered. As we have a strong family history of cancer I was really anxious. I was sent for a colonoscopy (the laxatives - ugh) and waited three weeks for the results. Irritable bowel!Even though I was very relieved I did not have cancer I was gutted to think I am stuck for life with this distressing condition. I went onto IBS Tales after reading about it and discovered one lady used slippery elm tablets, which I tried. It's been a while now and I feel much better - no bloat, no pain, no gurgling and better poops!

socializing and the work place.I began to use Digestive Advantage IBS found in drug stores...nine bucks for a month's supply. It carries probiotics or healthy bacteria for your intestines. I still cannot believe I can now eat whatever I want without the attacks which always followed. I can't believe I've had this for so long when the remedy was so simple. I can't tell you how many doctors I've been to see.I can also tell you that this has helped a great many others as well from the feedback on the support line, but it doesn't help everyone.

I suffer severe intestinal cramping to the point where my body would shake and I feel as though I am going to lose consciousness or throw up. Of course diarrhea is to follow until my body works whatever the agitator was out of my system.After years of excruciating pain, I was finally diagnosed with IBS and told to avoid certain foods. My life changed drastically! I now especially avoid milk (I'm also lactose intolerant), alcohol, and caffeine - the worst offenders. Citric acid kills me, so I watch for soda, lemons, limes, oranges, and tomato (especially sauces). Sugar and greasy (fast) foods are bad too.

I only get attacks when I decide to risk it, and I am always sorry.I also have tried two prescriptions for the cramping. Dicyclomine is a miracle drug. It kills the cramps in no less than 30 minutes. You can take it preventively too. The downside is that it makes me drowsy, so if I need to function, I only take 1/2. Hyoscyamine is less tranquilizing, but it doesn't work as well - still better than nothing. I am pregnant so I can't take either.

I too have had IBS for many years, but with symptoms that were somewhat off and on and not that life-altering.I moved to Germany five years ago, and four years ago I started having diarrhea every morning. I had the usual tests, and my doctor did not find anything wrong. After a course of antibiotics last fall my diarrhea got so bad that I started doing the rounds of GI doctors, as I was pretty much tied to the toilet. I tried medications to normalize the intestinal flora, and other medications that were prescribed with no lasting results.Out of total desperation and after reading about Digestive Advantage IBS on this website, I asked my mother to send me a couple of months of this medication. I was no better until day 13 when the diarrhea stopped, all urgency stopped, all of the inflamed feeling stopped, and I've been normal ever since. I thought I had a totally hopeless case, but the solution turned out to be so uncomplicated, other than the fact that I have to still have it sent to me from the States.

21,"Hello everyone, I would like to share my experience and maybe give you some hope that you can get better! My problems started with extreme bloating and indigestion when I was a teen. It usually occurred after spicy or greasy food, so I avoided them as much as possible. In my early 20s, after the birth of my first son, it got worse. So, I avoided the foods that bothered me and started a fitness routine and all was well. I would still suffer from constipation and bouts of diarrhea but it was manageable.At the age of 26, while pregnant with my second son, things really went downhill. I had to have my gallbladder removed after the birth of my son. Things were OK for a while but I had more and more diarrhea which I could control with diet. This is when I first heard the term IBS from my doctor. I accepted it, watched my diet, did cleanses every now and then. I was fine for awhile.Then the other symptoms started, itchy rashes, fatigue, pain in my joints, irritability, pain in my left colon, and constipation, which I could 
relieve by drinking coffee! I was sent for abarium enemaeval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_3']));and other tests. All was fine! I started yoga and my 
exercise routine, which I had not done for years, and once again watched my diet closely.In my early 30s once again all the symptoms returned, plus a new one, light-headedness after eating. This stumped the doctor and he did more tests including checking my heart. Once again all was fine. I still would break out in itchy hives and suffer alternating diarrhea and constipation. Everything was manageable until this spring. My son and I had a bout with bronchitis and were put on antibiotics. Big mistake.My body broke down. Non-stop explosive diarrhea after eating anything, and this lasted for weeks. Oh and my son had it as well. The doc did tests for c. difficile and other parasites, can you guess? All negative, of course! We slowly started to heal after about three months of diarrhea. I couldn't go anywhere if I had eaten something.I cried and thought this was it because I lost so much weight, and you know what my doctor said? Well, at least that's good and I'm not overweight. I'm five foot four and weighed 135lbs and went to 120lbs in eight weeks. I was scared!I started researching on the net and came across some sites about gluten intolerance. I had every symptom and so did my son. I restricted my gluten and dairy. Things started to firm up if you know what I mean. Anyways, I started to get better and started to eat things again. We went on vacation and I admit I ate badly. More bread than normal and even some dairy.When we got home I ate some veggie links (never ate them before) and five minutes after eating them I had explosive diarrhea and my ears went red hot with an itchy rash all over. This was an allergic reaction, so I looked at the ingredients and sure enough everything was gluten this and that! Bingo! I had bad diarrhea for three days! So did my son.OK, it's gluten, I'll go to the doc and get tested. Simple right? Yeah right! Two doctors smirked when I mentioned celiac disease and asked if I found it on the web. They handed me Dicetel for IBS and sent me on my way. I was furious! I threw out the meds and decided to do a strict gluten and dairy-free diet and guess what? I have never felt better in my whole life!No aches, I have energy, and the best part is that I poo normally! It's soft and formed and only once a day. I have no constant dull pain or ache in my colon area. My son is doing better too. No diarrhea for him which I'm so happy about! I'm not saying everyone is gluten intolerant or dairy. I just want everyone to trust their gut (no pun) about their own health.Doctors need to catch up with the food industry and the idea that what we consume is harming our bodies. Celiac is very common but doctors don't check for it. I'm Italian and in Italy it is the first thing they check for when a patient presents with diarrhea. It is very common if you're from European ancestry. Even though I haven't been medically proven to be lactose and gluten intolerant it works for me.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_0']));I also have started walking for 30 minutes a day and find that helps also. I have eliminated caffeine and cut back on fruit. I'm actually eating 
much better than I ever have and have many options for snacks, since there are a lot of gluten-free foods now. I don't know if the antibiotics 
triggered this or if after many years of subtle hints my body tried to tell me, it finally broke down and the antibiotics just pushed my body to its 
limits.I think I have been intolerant all my life but I ignored the symptoms. Plus, most doctors are useless and narrow-minded! Even though I have been well for a while I still get nervous if we go out all day or I have something scheduled. I fear I'll have diarrhea again.So, I totally understand how the mind is very powerful and can play a role with bowel problems. I also do rotation diets and don't eat the same foods everyday which also helps with food intolerances. I wish you all well and after 20 years of problems, I believe I have found my road to recovery and better health. Please feel free to contact me.

22,"I have had IBS for years, and my gastroenterologist never could figure out my problem. I had it bad one day and my husband told me to go to another gastroenterologist, a lady, which I did. After an examination in her office, she read my paper from other doctors that I have been to, and she looked at me and said, you have been to all these other doctors and they never told you that you have IBS.She wrote a prescription for IBS and I told her I use herbs and I don't like taking medicine because of all the side effects. She said if I don't take the medication I don't need to come back, so I went home and had it filled, but when I saw it could make me have a stroke, heart attack and other symptoms I declined to take it.So my husband got looking in herb books and told me about Wild Yam.

Depression, weight gain, panic attacks which make IBS worse. I have had all the tests.I also had a fistula develop on my left butt cheek after I had my daughter. I had an eight-inch tunnel from my rectum to a hole in my left 
butt cheek. When I went to the bathroom it came out both holes. And since it was diarrhea most of the time you can only imagine how painful it was. It has since healed.I have taken Lomotil for years. It stops the painful stomach cramps and diarrhea in 30 minutes after you take it. But your body gets used to it and sometimes it does not work. My internist also put me on Colestid, which is for high cholesterol (although I do not have high cholesterol). Colestid takes off all the bad fat and other bad things your body digests to cause high cholesterol, but fat is also one thing that triggers IBS attacks. I take one in the morning and one at night.No more diarrhea! No more stomach cramps! I also followed the Atkins diet. Not a lot of red meat though and I lost 23 pounds. It helped a lot too.If I do feel that I am getting constipated I stop the meds the next day and I use the bathroom. I have been living with this for 15 years now. This has helped me. And there are no side effects except constipation. And I have found that sometimes when I go to the bathroom my stool clumps up like little rabbit pellets but that is better than the alternative.When your stomach does not hurt and you feel like you are not going to have a diarrhea attack you can get up and do things and you feel better. And you forget in your head that you are going to have a diarrhea attack and you are not so worried about a bathroom.

Yes, I do have moments maybe once or twice a month, but nothing like it used to be. Nothing I can't handle. And what helps even more is that I sit right across from another girl at work who is a little younger than me who has also been diagnosed.

27,"I am currently beginning treatment for my IBS, which appears to be candida related. For more than four years I have had stomach issues that 
have gotten progressively worse. What started as sporadic bouts of constipation turned into frequent constipation, then diarrhea and, over the 
last year, near daily diarrhea episodes that left me drenched in sweat and exhausted like I have never been before.During the same time span I began suffering from chronic yeast infections which would reappear every time my husband and I had sex. My regular GP put us both on Flagyl and Diflucan but the symptoms returned every time we went off it. While this was going on, my husband began developing his own set of gastrointestinal problems, mainly very bad smelling gas, stomach pains and frequent trips to the bathroom.At first his doctor thought his symptoms were some kind of virus left over from his last bout of 'food poisoning' (which I now think was an IBS flare-up). Later I thought it was wheat intolerance and then my husband thought it was from long-term use of Celebrex, which he had been taking for years. He stopped the Celebrex and then found he could tolerate wheat for a time.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));During this same time period my GP sent me to a gynecologist for my stubborn yeast infections and chronic vaginitis, and the gynecologist put me on Diflucan once a week. This seemed to help the female infection problems but my intestinal issues became worse and I also started to suffer from numerous vague and seemingly unrelated problems such as brain fog, loss of concentration, chills, mood swings, exhaustion, depression, achy joints and an occasional irregular heart rhythm.Sometimes I could hardly drag myself through the day and on days when I had frequent bathroom trips I was so tired it was all I could do to put dinner on the table for my family. I went back to my GP to ask about these symptoms and what I thought could be hypoglycemia or diabetes, as I would become shaky and weak very quickly at times and craved sugar and baked goods. She ran blood tests and told me I was perfectly healthy.I never connected all the symptoms so I didn't mention the gastro issues to her. I had a lot going on with my business (I work from home, thank goodness!) and my extended family and I thought they must be from stress. I also stopped eating wheat and gluten thinking that might be it. That seemed to work for a short time to alleviate the diarrhea but then it came right back, even worse than before.I tried taking acidophilus but thought I was allergic to it when I broke out two days later in a rash, so I stopped. Now I know I was probably 
starting to detox from the yeast. My husband, in the meantime, had such horrendous gas that I had to air out the house almost daily and sometimes ask him to sleep downstairs on the couch because of the smell. (As you can imagine, this does wonders for the old love life...not.) Both of us were using a variety of gas relief and gastro OTC medicines like Gas-X, Pepto and the like.Finally, last month, I went back to my GP in total desperation for fatigue and gastro problems. It may just sound like I am whining, but I really cannot express how run down and terrible I felt nearly every day. I've been a vegetarian for years but became so weak that I started to eat organic chicken in an attempt to get some protein and gain my energy back. I started to think I might have cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome.My GP pretty much dismissed my fatigue and told me I probably had IBS but could have Crohn's or a number of other problems and told me to schedule a colonoscopy. At that point I began researching IBS and eventually found my way to some candida information. As I read through the symptoms I had a huge A-ha! moment and decided to research the matter as much as I could.Much of the information I came across suggested a strong link between IBS, candida or yeast and Leaky Gut Syndrome. I decided to take matters into my own hands since my GP was of no use. I figured, 'Heck! What do I have to lose?' I started by cutting out all refined sugar and flour products as well as NutraSweet type products. Within two days my brain fog was lifting and, although I still had diarrhea, it toned down considerably.My husband started a colon cleanse program and began taking a product called Yeast Defense. Both products were recommended by my local natural pharmacy and seem to be providing some relief. I was leery to start acidophilus again because of my previous detox reaction so I drink a yogurt like drink called Kefir that is enhanced with 'good bacteria'.Both my husband and I tested our urine Ph and found that we were too acidic, which I have read contributes to an unhealthy ratio of good and bad bacteria in the intestines. We have both started to take a calcium supplement to help correct that. In addition, I take a multivitamin and 
flax oil daily. Both of us appear to have lost inches from our waist because the constant bloating is decreasing.I've also found a naturopath in my area and have scheduled an appointment for further consultation and help with a thorough system detox because of my previous die-off reaction. Even though it has been only a week of changes we both feel much better. We are excited to go places and have the energy to do things again without worrying about bathroom issues or suffering from mood swings and exhaustion.Best of luck to everyone out there dealing with these issues.

The IBS started when I went self-employed and the worry of how to pay the next month's rent and food was too much for my system to take. As a hypnotherapist explained, all that nervous energy had to escape somehow - and the route it took was my arse!About five years ago it was quite bad and I decided that it was about time I explored my options. I went to the doctors who fobbed my off saying there wasn't much that could be done. Not satisfied with that I went back with my assertive head on and demanded to see a dietician in order to explore food intolerances properly and with guidance.The woman I saw was great and started me off with a high fiber diet (based on my symptoms) - not a good start as it got worse. Next I tried a wheat-free diet and there was a mild improvement in that the wind and bloating disappeared. Based on that, she put me on a low fiber diet and 
bingo!In all my reading up on IBS I have never come across any suggestion of a low fiber diet as I guess it seems a bit upside-down for diarrhea symptoms. I truly would recommend it - but I expect one should consult with a doctor or dietician first.Basically I avoid brown bread, brown anything, high fiber cereals, and keep high fiber fruit and vegetables like broccoli and bananas to a minimum. It doesn't sound very healthy I know, and it is a kid's dream diet! However, after being very strict with it for a few years I have incorporated more fruit and veg in. I avoid onions, mushrooms (though I think that intolerance dates back to my mother giving me pureed mushrooms as my first ever meal as a baby!) and too many tomatoes are a killer.All I now need to do is find a way of getting control over the anxiety - any tips that don't involve going to things like yoga classes? The worry of going to a class, not knowing anyone and thus setting off the old IBS is not worth the trouble! I'm sure you know what I mean!I hope this might be of some help to some of you and feel free to contact me and I can give you more of an idea of what I eat and avoid.

29,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I've had stomach problems for about a year and a half now. At first it was just pain and discomfort, but then I got the lovely big D to accompany it. Thankfully, I'm still pretty lucky - I have never had an accident in public, and only drastic urgency twice - but both times I was able to make it the 10 minutes home.The problem is, I'm a traveler. In fact, I'm spending three months traveling around Europe this summer - a bit of a daunting prospect. However, I lived in the US for six months this year and I heard about Digestive Advantage. I started it about three weeks ago. I was a bit discouraged, because I didn't really notice a real improvement after the first week.Thus, like the package suggested, I began taking two pills. Although I had one of the senses of urgency in the past three weeks, I'd say my 
condition has improved greatly. I have more frequent bowel movements than I remember before IBS, but they are usually much more normal. I have still gotten the Big D, although it's never extremely serious for me, once or twice a week. Hopefully, however, as Digestive Advantage takes a month for full effectiveness (maybe more for me, as it seems my bowels are a bit more picky about this pill), this will improve. And this past week was better than week two, so I feel pretty good.I used to also take Imodium several times a week, and this is why I wanted to try something different - I didn't like the idea of having that in 
my system all the time (although it worked great!). I still use maybe half a pill a week, just if I'm a bit nervous. I find if I wait it out and don't take Imodium, that the uncomfortable feeling that used to suggest diarrhea is actually just gas. Not entirely pleasant either, mind you, but better than the alternative in my opinion. I'm having some Digestive Advantage Gas Prevention pills shipped to me too - to see if they might help that out. But gas also seems to be getting better as I'm getting used to the pill.After starting Digestive Advantage, I get a little sick feeling every time I eat, and can't seem to eat as much. I've also noticed that greasy, sugary, or carbonated foods/beverages cause more gas, more pain (and this is on the Digestive Advantage pill, mind you), thus likely they would cause more diarrhea (and the one urgent occasion, I had just had McDonald's). Thus, I'm trying to eat healthier - drink juices or water instead of pop, eat less of those foods (a bit of a bummer, as I like them, but I like comfortable bowels more!) It's strange that this became noticeable after I started the Digestive Advantage pills. But, in any case, it's probably good - I'll be eating healthier!I read about Caltrate Plus on this website, so I got some to try. I've just been on it for a day, so we'll see how that helps! I just take one pill. I also take a fiber supplement.Finally, I take a B-Complex vitamin. It replenishes the vitamins that your body uses up in stress - physical (as well as emotional). I know that IBS is very physically hard, as well as emotionally difficult, so this helps your body!That's pretty much all, and I hope it works as I'm preparing to go! Although I don't like having fragile bowels, I've realized I'm not too serious compared to some of you. The only good thing I can take away from it is that I've learned to listen to my body, and take better care of it (I also am going to try to get more sleep, and exercise more). I will be praying for you all. Best of luck!E-mail Gabrielle:[email protected]",P,pill,gas,body,email,vitamin,beverage,food,pain,home,stomach
30,"When I first visited this site a year ago, I was depressed, miserable, and searching for answers. I had been suffering from chronic nausea, bloating, stomach pain, and irregular bowel movements for over six years, and every doctor I saw told me it was IBS. But as the years went on, my symptoms grew worse and it became increasingly difficult to function. None of the drugs or supplements I tried provided me with any relief from the constant pain.Then six months ago I saw a naturopath who first told me about celiac disease, or gluten intolerance. The symptoms appeared to be similar to what I was feeling so I researched it and made an appointment with my GI. I found I couldn't wait two months until the appointment to find out if this was my problem so I immediately cut gluten from my diet. At first, I wasn't sure if it was helping or not, but by the end of the second week I could tell a profound difference. Within a month, most of my symptoms had completely disappeared.It has been seven months now without gluten and I am a new person. I no longer take any medication, down from six pills a day to help me cope with the pain. Celiac disease is commonly referred to as the great pretender, and is most often misdiagnosed as IBS. A simple blood test can rule out celiac as a possible cause of symptoms.I hope this helps someone - when I was sick I was feeling there would never be another day when I felt like a normal human being. At the darkest moments, I was suicidal because of the misery that I felt no-one else could understand. It is so frustrating that so many people thought it was all in my head! Keep searching for answers, there is always hope that things will get better someday.E-mail Elizabeth:[email protected]",N,pain,celiac disease,email,appointment,person,head,head,people,celiac,exam
31,"I am writing because I have been living with IBS since I was about 16 years old. I will be 24 in a week. I hated life. I hated to go away with my friends. I hated to go to work (especially the driving part), I hated to be in a vehicle unless it was a bus with a bathroom on it! I was miserable.It was the same thing every day. Eat, get terrible unbearable abdominal pain and then run for the bathroom and hope I make it. Actually going was the only thing that would make the abdominal pain go away. Not Imodium or any other type of diarrhea pill or liquid.Finally, I had had enough. I couldn't live this way. I went to a different doctor this time, pleaded my case and cried to her. She was my savior, only I didn't know it yet...She prescribed Paxil 10mg tablet once daily. Being a pharmacy technician, I thought this was strange because it was a depression medication. Yes, I was slightly depressed from the diarrhea, but I wanted the diarrhea to go away!She told me that this pill is used also as a bowel calmer. I couldn't believe it. I thought, great, another 20-dollar co-pay down the drain. I was 
wrong. I started taking one tablet daily of the Paxil and a calcium tablet every night before bed. A few days went by and I realized that I wasn't 
going to the bathroom. Not diarrhea, and not regularly either...but you know what, that was fine with me. I eventually would have to go.Well, I did...a few days later. And guess what? It was normal. No pain, No diarrhea. I was astonished. But I didn't want to get my hopes up too soon. I decided to start marking the days I had diarrhea on the calendar. Guess what? I marked two days in one month. Unbelievable! Two days? It used to be like 20 days!It has been two full months now that I have been on Paxil and calcium and I will never go off it as long as I live. In two months, I have been able to eat normally, and live normally. My life is back.E-mail Tiffany:[email protected]",NEU,pill,tablet,toilet,pain,tablet,email,calcium,repairman,friend,bed
32,"Although I probably always had slightly temperamental bowels growing up, it wasn't until I was 20 and transferred to a new school that IBS fully claimed me and my life. I do not know what the main trigger was, but the very unhealthy and greasy cafeteria food at my university, the stress of a new relationship in the midst of this problem at an age where I was still too modest to share, a hectic work/school schedule that allowed little time for sleep, and the stress of using a public bathroom definitely all contributed.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));That first semester of my life at this new college was a nightmare that found me oftentimes in the bathroom several to a dozen times on any given day (and in a public bathroom in a dorm - how embarrassing!). Often, out of desperation, I double-dosed on Imodium, which then only constipated me for days or up to a week until I had another set of explosions.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I skipped classes and work, and was threatened with being fired. I am sure IBS sufferers understand this: having this medical problem that's 
embarrassing to explain but threatens your whole livelihood. I lost about 20 pounds that semester (and I was already skinny to begin with) and was simply a miserable person to be around. My boyfriend told me so and broke up with me. I was afraid to go out and didn't even explore the town.The next semester, I wound up taking a leave of absence and returning home (not a very happy place for me, but the lesser of two evils at this point) where I subjected myself to a series of tests - colonoscopy, barium enema, rectal exams, stool samples, etc. When ulcerative colitis and Crohn's were ruled out, making IBS the only diagnosis, my doctor no longer had any interest in me, as though I was at fault, and gave me no more input on my life. Doctors can be so insensitive at times.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));When I returned to school, I requested moving into a suite (which meant a private bathroom), lessened my work and school load, and argued my way out of having a full meal plan so that I could buy a lot of my own food instead. Of course, school officials accused me of being anorexic for my weight loss and were totally misunderstanding, but after I threatened to file official charges (after all, I did have a formal letter from my gastroenterologist backing me up) for not helping me with this issue, I got what I wanted.This all helped a little, in some cases a lot, and I had a better life. However, I still had very bad bouts and my life was still tedious at a lot 
of points, but at least it was a life. There were a couple of times where I soiled myself, but luckily it was always just as I made it to my bathroom, 
in the privacy of my suite, so I was spared public embarrassment. I was still embarrassed for myself, though.I have put up with IBS on and off for several years now, mostly with diarrhea, but even some horrible problems with constipation, and only in the past three years have I seen significantly consistent improvement. First of all, I also have a menstrual disorder known as endometriosis, which causes extremely painful periods due to growth of endometrium in other pelvic areas. Well, after being diagnosed with this, I had laser surgery to remove as much of it as was possible. Turns out a great deal of it was on my intestines! I am sure that contributed to some of the problem as within six months of this surgery, my IBS became a lot more tolerable.Other things that have helped are diet and holistic therapy. I find that acupuncture/magnet therapy (even with Chinese herbs) and yoga really do help, even deep tissue and shiatsu massage. Some of my health insurance covered this, and some not, and though it sometimes was expensive it was worth it.And even though for the longest time I thought it didn't matter what I ate, diet really does matter. I gave up coffee and switched to tea (coffee = bad, but oh I loved it). I am really careful and conservative with greasy food and overly acidic food (I usually put olive oil on my pasta instead of tomato sauce). I usually take slippery elm with at least one meal a day. I also take one or two 'swallowable' (not chewable) acidophilus tablets almost everyday to keep my gut flora in check. I drink lots of chamomile and ginger tea.Most of all, I make sure my diet is based on soluble fiber or 'white foods' such as bananas, rice, oatmeal, white pasta, white breads, etc. Not 
that that's all I eat, but I make sure to have some of these everyday. A great website, Help for IBS, speaks more of this and it's helped me more than any doctor. I also take one or two flaxseed oil pills every other day with food, except for when I am having a diarrhea bout, or feel like I might - it makes it worse then. Flaxseed also helps with my terrible menstrual cramps and helps keep me regular (both period and bowel movements).When I am getting/have a really bad case of diarrhea, I find charcoal (only one or two tablets) helps a lot more than Imodium and won't constipate me. I only take this during extreme break-outs as taking charcoal regularly can absorb vitamins and nutrients as well as bad stuff. Doctors also prescribed Librax or Bentyl, an intestinal muscle relaxant, that I only take when cramps get really bad, and it helps. Other things that sometimes help are Equalactin and digestive enzymes (sparingly - I don't depend on either).Things that I found do not help are Imodium (it sometimes stops diarrhea if I take enough of it, but then constipates me terribly and just creates a cycle), Metamucil, Citrucel, aloe vera juice, psyllium (all cause bloating, gas, diarrhea), stimulant laxatives (make me go too much), and Fleet enemas. I found that during constipation, a plain warm water enema is better than one with salt, and only used in extreme situations. I haven't had to use one in years, though. Enemas can make you dependent on them and then you can never train your body to go on its own.The hardest part of IBS is still always acknowledging that there are some things I might never be able to do. I will never be able to go camping and rough it for weeks at a time, as I'd like to. I need to be close to a bathroom and I need my special diet. I can't live on canned beans in the wilderness. I wish I could. But I can't. I also can't just scarf down a bunch of nachos and a pitcher of beer. I will never to be able to eat with abandon, but always with caution and prejudice. But I can have a few nachos and a bit of beer, if I am careful, and must accept that sometimes even that might be a problem (but if I am safe, not usually).My job and life are no longer in constant jeopardy and I can do most of the things 'normal people' can do. And I used to think IBS would kill me. I am also in a relationship with an understanding boyfriend. If someone doesn't understand or makes you feel worse about it, they are not worth it and will only make it worse for you.So I thank whatever higher power there is that it's better and hope maybe this will help other people/women out here (especially the endometriosis tip).E-mail Laurie:[email protected]",N,food,toilet,school,doctor,doctor,diet,pill,white,job,leave of absence
33,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I do not know where I stand really. I suffer from alternating IBS, but I am no longer severely constipated (I was for 22 years!). A change of diet and TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) has sorted that out. However, I now live in fear of going too much. But then again, one day I might not go, be happy about that, but pay for it the next day (frequent loose movements, not diarrhea).I will not eat when out, I refuse to go to meals, and I hardly ever go somewhere after eating, especially breakfast or lunch. I've lost two stone, half a stone in a week (slightly worrying), and it looks like this may continue. For some reason, I calm down by dinner. I travel a lot, so I need to take something for my nervous stomach. Even if I think I might be OK for needing the loo, I take something anyway.I'm not ashamed to admit I'm psychologically addicted to the one prescription drug I know will prevent my bowels from maybe exploding - that's codeine phosphate. To start with, you feel drowsy, but by now I'm used to it and I love how relaxed I feel. But I also feel guilty, as if I'm cheating, and I should just get over my anxiety attacks...Anyway, I do not know then if this is really a happy story (as Codeine is only to be taken as a short-term drug). But if I am going to an event, or traveling long distances, and don't want to worry, this is a brilliant drug. It slows down movement in the intestines, and hasn't let me down. I don't take too much, or I would be away with the fairies 24/7.I only take one if I'm doing long distances, need to be away from a loo for a long time, or have eaten something bad - one works for about four hours for me. My doctor wasn't too keen on prescribing me more since my bout of bad diarrhea has gone (thank God). I think he realizes I have come to rely on it, and I won't go anywhere without it in my handbag for reassurance. But if it gives an IBS sufferer a day to enjoy themselves...It's also an amazing painkiller, brilliant for that time of the month, when you thought your abdomen could take no more! (Please note that this is the only conventional drug I take.)I am very curious to see if anyone out there is suffering from what they think is going to be an attack of diarrhea, but instead, it's just an attack of mucus? I am beginning to think there is something else wrong with me when my bowels produce this substance. It's pretty odorless, sometimes just a bit like water, sometimes like honey.I used to bleed horrendously from constipation, but that was just that - constipation. But why is mucus appearing? It's not diarrhea, but it's just as noisy, embarrassing and discomforting, especially when you thought you might produce some solid stools with it (at least!). I instantly get butterflies. At least you know diarrhea is a form of a stool, but I have no idea why the liquid lining of my intestines is leaking out?! I get it regardless of eating, or my mood (but no, I would not swap it for the runs!).Also, I am interested if other IBS sufferers have had a lot of UTIs (urine infections)? I had two bad bouts of a severe bladder infection (I 
thought I was actually dying) just when my IBS was at its worst, and my doc said it can be related to IBS.E-mail Claire:[email protected]",NEU,drug,attack,attack,attack,attack,email,infection,constipation,distance,codeine
34,"I am 30 years old. I have only been diagnosed with IBS for 18 months, but believe I have been suffering since my early teens. I have been to the doctors on a regular basis complaining about my symptoms and every time I got fobbed off. As I hadn't heard of IBS, I never even thought it could be that. It was only through nagging that I finally got something done and I was sent for an operation, laparoscopy, where they put a camera through your belly button.It was after this that I was diagnosed with IBS. I was also told by the doctor that my bowels are sitting in the wrong place and sit right on my female organs and they contract against each other. The pain is unbearable, to the point that I collapse. The doctor laughed when telling me all of this, as she said they had had me upside down in the theater trying to dislodge my bowels, but they were staying put.I do all the things I am supposed to, watch my diet, am a keen exerciser and lead a very healthy lifestyle. I have been given several medications to try, but my complaint with the doctors is that nobody monitors what you are taking, how often, if it's working, the side effects, or if your body is becoming used to these drugs. They have never asked me my medical history - my father suffers with diverticulitis, and my grandmother had bowel cancer. More should be done and I feel IBS should be monitored every six months to a year.The toilet habits are a pain and my boss says there should be a turn-style on the loo as I go that often. Nobody understands and it's seen as a bit of joke. I went home ill last week with it and my boss said to me that was for the best as he didn't want me to pass it round, what can you say to that?

35,"I'm 23 and have been suffering from IBS for four years. I have for the most part been suffering from diarrhea-predominant IBS, along with gas, bloating and painful stomach cramps every day. I take Imodium regularly just to be able to get on with life. I have done so much research around irritable bowel syndrome, desperate for an answer to this problem and so fed up with taking pills everyday.I am so glad I came across this website, as it has brought up so many different treatments and opinions from real people suffering the same discomfort as me. It is so easy to think you're the only one out there sometimes, so it really helps to read other people's stories.I have recently started taking Benefiber in tablet form and also Caltrate 600. Since taking these I have had considerably less frequent bowel 
movements, it doesn't make me constipated, but it does mean I'm not rushing to the loo every five minutes, which is really amazing. I do suffer a lot from excess gas from taking added fiber supplements, but hopefully this should settle down.As well as trying out various supplements, I also visit a therapist who specializes in hypnotherapy and relaxation techniques. I believe my IBS 
started after a traumatic family event, as ever since I have suffered from terrible anxiety attacks which make my IBS worse. The therapy, however, has helped me to stay calm and control my anxiety, which I believe helps manage my IBS.I have felt like on occasions IBS does make my life a complete misery, and I do get down about it, but I won't let it ruin my life.

graduated from university and I am determined to do well in my chosen career, with or without IBS. For everyone out there who suffers with 
diarrhea day after day, don't let it control you, don't let it get you down, I know it's hard, but there are ways to manage it. I think it helps just

My biggest problem has been a bloated and painful stomach, but also varying stools, from morning-after-diarrhea to sudden-and-impossible constipation. I've tried all the tricks and meds out there, but have finally found something that works, and I just have to spread the word.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I read about something called the SCD (specific carbohydrate diet) which seemed like such a hassle. Still, the theory that certain types of carbs feed the kind of intestinal microbes that cause symptoms consistent with for example Crohn's disease and IBS seemed believable. I soon realized that it's pretty much like a low carb or slow carb diet. So I tried the trendiest diet (easy to follow because everybody knows about it) here in Sweden, the Glycemic Index diet. It's basically a slow carb diet that excludes sugars, white flour, and other 'fast' carbs.It has set me free. My stomach actually works, the pain and bloating is gone and I have a bowel movement every 24 hours (I know this is too much info but from one IBS sufferer to another, you know what big a deal it is). I could never have imagined that it was the bread that messed up my system! For years I've excluded things like coffee, alcohol and dairy products, but I can now eat all of them again! Not in excess, of course, but that's true for most people.I'm also lactose sensitive so I don't drink pure milk, but can now eat stuff like cheese. The second I commit a sin and eat something sugary or 
light bread, my stomach gets painful and blows up to pregnant-size. The difference is just so dramatic. Apart from my stomach working the way it should, my whole body and blood sugar levels feel very balanced. An example of what I eat in a typical day:Breakfast: cheese omelet with slices of ham or turkey and veggies, low-lactose yogurt with home-made muesli (which has walnuts, pecans and sunflower seeds as a base and often includes a little dried fruit - apple is best - and just a tiny handful of unsweetened regular muesli or all-bran flakes), or super duper dark bread (typical Danish bread with whole seeds, only 35% carbs) with cheese and veggies. Tea or coffee.Lunch: Tuna fish salad with an egg, some cottage cheese and an extra tomato.Dinner: One filet of chicken, beef or fish with a good sauce and veggies - either a salad or baked in the oven.For snacks I eat nuts, fruit, cheeses, yogurt, ham/turkey slices, cottage cheese, carrots, boiled eggs etc. Coffee and wine are fine to drink, 
although I mainly stick to water.It's important to stick to slow carbs that you find in whole meal pasta, parboiled rice, beans, very dark bread, etc. Yes, everything is rich in fiber but (despite my problems basically being due to gas) I'm way better than before! I used to eat white bread/crackers/oatmeal/white rice because I thought I was being nice to my stomach! In fact it was making it worse.Basically you stick to very fresh food, the way mother Earth gives it to us and the way we ate way back when, before sugar - anything processed is likely to cause trouble. I haven't been to the States, but I've been to Canada, and one thing that really hit me is how hard it was to find non-processed food (this was even before I was on the diet).I mean, dark or whole meal bread was still only slightly darker than white bread! I went to an American school as a kid, and I remember the other kids having chips, crackers and cookies for lunch. I always tried to trade away my fruits and crisp bread sandwiches! Here in Sweden, over-processed food is really frowned upon and though it definitely exists, the amounts aren't near those of North America. Still, the low carb diets are of course very popular over there as well and I did notice that it was much easier to find it in the restaurants than it is here.I hope that this could maybe help someone, if only even a little.

There will be fellow IBS buddies. And there are doctors who try with all their hearts to fix you up. And everybody who survives with this eventually finds a way to cope that works for them.

54,"I am a 62 year-old Australian woman, and I have had this problem since 1994. What I have found is that nerves appear to be the first thing that trigger the problem. I also find that MSG (a flavor enhancer used a lot in Chinese foods) and chili are triggers as well. Lots of foods like tinned soups can contain MSG, and reactions from this can take minutes.Upon my husband's transfer to the UK in 2000 I had to have surgery, and the subject of IBS came up with the surgeon. He stated that there is no such thing, there is always an underlying problem in the gut. I have to admit I am now finding out what can affect me personally, and lactose is one thing that I stay clear of. Also it appears that a lack of biotin and the multivitamin Bs can cause the runs.Some IBS attacks are very traumatic, so much so that I have had to go to emergency in the local hospital as my pulse rate went over 122. I passed out and cannot remember one and a half hours, and I was dehydrated.It stands to reason that when the body hates something and wishes to get rid of it violently all the minerals and vitamins are going to get washed down the toilet too. These need replacing, so I keep handy Megadophilus, a large dose of lactobacillus organisms. Very good for going traveling when different water is alien to our bodies.I am no expert, but I have continually researched what is good for my body, and what assistance I can give my body. Having had three colonoscopies and bowel x-rays I delight in finding what affects my own problems, as I feel this continual sensitivity to some foodstuffs and colorings triggers off side effects and leaves the body with an unbalanced flora.Diagnosed with a heart valve problem some years ago, I was for years given mega-doses of antibiotics that turned my flora upside down, and I am sure this was the beginning of my problems. As it turned out five years later the diagnosis was wrong, and my heart valve did not have a problem!I can only finish in saying that if I was able to put the clock back I would restrict my intake of antibiotics, I would keep Megadophilus handy 
when traveling, and I would eat as many natural products as possible. The sprays farmers put on our crops do have an effect on our bodies after 
several years. For that reason I much prefer to eat organic vegetables, fruits and manufactured cereals, and it does help me.E-mail Carol:[email protected]",,body,side effect,email,food,trigger,flora,heart,valve,vitamin,antibiotic
55,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I am 28 and I have been recently diagnosed with IBS. It all started in November 2004 when I was out with friends. We had been for a pizza and we were going on to a club. We stopped off at a bar and all of a sudden I needed the loo. It was a pretty crowded bar so this made me panic. Luckily, I was able to make it to the loo on time - several times over! In the end I had to ring my dad and get him to pick me up; by the time he arrived there couldn't have been anything left in me.I treated this as a one-off, but sure enough a week later I was going to a friend's house with my boyfriend and we had to stop off at the local 
supermarket, where I spent a good half an hour in the toilet. I got my boyfriend to take me home and spent the rest of the night by the loo. I was gutted. It is then that I decided to go to the doctor as I had never had toilet problems before. (Needless to say that after the second attack I was afraid of going out again).The first doctor said I was probably stressed and it was when I began to relax (at the weekends) that everything else relaxed too - including my bowel. This was plausible since my job has a reputation for being incredibly stressful, but I did not feel stressed as I enjoyed it.Over the next few months I saw three other doctors who all had a go at prescribing a different anti-spasmodic each. None of these worked. 
I found out about Imodium - having never had diarrhea previously I had never heard of it. It turned out to be my savior, especially in getting me 
to work.After a while I had not improved and I was relying on a daily dose of Imodium to get me out of the house. I couldn't understand how I had gone from being very regular and 'normal' to this! So I went back to the doctor because I really wanted a second opinion and I was worried about the amount of Imodium I was taking. She passed me on to a specialist who said that a daily dose of Imodium was fine, but the liquid version would be better as you can get the dosage more accurate.The specialist then referred me to a dietician who put me on a low fiber diet (she was meant to put me on an elimination diet). The low fiber diet worked thankfully, but not to any great extent as I was still getting diarrhea and taking Imodium (although these had reduced from every day to on average twice a week). I went back to the doctor as I had developed bleeding, and she sent me back to the specialist who, after subjecting me to a colonoscopy (it's not actually that bad - the worst part is the taste of the bowel cleanser), sent me back to the head dietician with strict instructions.The elimination diet made me worse, even when I was using Imodium (almost daily) as well. I kept with it just in case but she took me off it straight away when I went back for a check-up. It turned out I was severely allergic to soya (which had been one of the few things I was allowed to eat on the diet, so I had been consuming more than usual), and intolerant to dairy. I was also advised to leave out monosodium glutamate and yeast.This was all diagnosed last month. After three years of diarrhea I am now combating the psychological dramas that come with the urgency of needing the loo (or next bush) ie: panic attacks. I have developed these in the last three years which has made it all worse - even though I have left the offending ingredients out of my diet I still panic in case I do feel ill when I am out - I have become so used to it.I cannot go to crowded places in case there aren't enough toilets or there's a queue. I have not had an accident yet but I am prepared: I have an 'emergency pack' which fits in my nice, fashionable, large handbag. It contains: Imodium Plus and Instants (normal Imodium doesn't work with me - I am told this is because they work in different ways), wet wipes, lots of tissues, and a plastic bag (and my car also contains a large ice cream container for traffic jams).

56,"I am 26 years old, and my first experience with IBS was when I was 17. I got very sick while I was out with my boyfriend at the time (he is now my husband). Long story short...I had it for six months to a year the first time, and then it eased up for a while and I didn't start having it again until years later.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));I have been diagnosed with it. I have had endoscopies, sigmoidoscopies, and a full colonoscopy. I have had stool studies, tons of blood work and been through hell, all for yet another doctor to tell me that I, along with many other women out there, have IBS.When I first had it, after months of being afraid to go out, because I would get diarrhea, I decided that I must be making myself sick. I kept a 
food journal and wrote down everything that I ate all day long. I noticed some things that would bother me that I never thought about before. Not just dairy, but greasy food, things that weren't really that spicy but were too much for me, and little things like pizza sauce or thousand island dressing (that kills me!).eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));Anyway, I eventually just stopped having episodes. Then of course years later they popped up again. I got to the point that I hated the way I was. I felt like I was young and should be out enjoying my life, instead of being stuck at home, afraid to go out, because as soon as I got a certain distance away from home I would feel that old familiar cramping, burning feeling that told me I was going to get sick.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I really like my medical doctor that I am seeing now. He takes the time and talks to me about my problem. He said that it is safe to take Imodium to prevent diarrhea. He jokingly told me that I should have a baby, because that would stop me from worrying about myself. Then I decided that he was right. Why do I worry about getting sick all the time? What was the one thing that started all this?I sat down and thought it over. The first time I got sick, I had broken up with my first love for my now husband. Us women are so emotionally attached to people that even though it is the right move, we still have a very hard time letting go and moving on without carrying around the stress of the past. I realized that I stopped being sick when I got over him.So, years later me and my husband went through a hard time, where I was very stressed out. Shortly afterwards, I started getting sick again. So, a lot of the reason that I have gotten sick and stayed sick in the past is because there is something that is bothering me. It sounds crazy, but if 
there's something that you have been through that really has bothered you, whether it was a divorce, marriage problems, children, jobs...whatever - you may not realize just how stressed out you are, because you just keep working and keep going through it.But stress does manifest itself in some way, and many times, that way is through gastric upset and sickness. Think about it...haven't you ever made yourself sick worrying over a presentation you had to make in front of the class, or a trip you have to take? Ever notice that when you are off work and at home and relaxed, without stress, knowing that you don't have to go anywhere, you don't get sick on the days when you can stay home. You get sick right before you go to work, or an appointment, or anything new or out of the ordinary that worries you.We sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes do it to ourselves. We usually can't help it, but we do. Although IBS is pretty much chronic, and I will always have occasional flare-ups, I don't have to let them control my life. I have learned that when I am going down the road, almost at my destination, and I feel that cramping, burning feeling that I am all too well familiar with, I just take deep breaths and tell myself that I can do this. It's going to be alright and I am stronger than this.I think about what is the worst thing that could happen (I have had panic attacks in the past too) and I decide that the worst thing is that I will 
get diarrhea and have to go to the bathroom. It's not going to kill me, It's no big deal. There are tons of women out there like me, and it is OK if I 
have to go to the bathroom. Once you feel this way about it, it's like it doesn't have this power over you anymore.You control your mind and your thoughts. Your mind controls your body. You can make your condition worse by freaking out and panicking about it, or you can take control of it, and make it through it. I know a lot of people out there will disagree with me and think that they've tried everything, and haven't been able to control it, but I wanted to share my story and tell you that I too went through a period - long periods - where I felt hopeless and even became depressed.But I am stronger than that and so are you.

As she touched my finger with the pen-like thing the machine made a beeping noise and by the sound it made she could tell what foods aggravated me. I was amazed by how accurate it was.

He's now told me that I have intolerances and to avoid what upsets me, and diagnosed me with IBS. His exact words were 'I don't like French films so I avoid them. You should do the same'. Some help he was.I know when I am going to get an attack as during the night I get cramping, and I feel as if my intestines are expanding like a balloon blowing up and then going down, and if I press down on the right-hand side of my tummy I can feel it. It feels like when a baby kicks in your tummy. I 
wake up the next morning and have to go and can't stop until I take two Imodium. Eating late at night causes problems too.After three and a half years, after finding most of my trigger foods and avoiding stress as much as possible, although I do still get an attack on 
average once a week, and more during my period, I can cope with my symptoms better. Imodium is my best friend and I take it as often as I need to.I feel for anyone who suffers like me, only other sufferers seem to have any sympathy. I am going to try taking calcium next as I completely avoid dairy. If anyone else has any other ideas on a cure feel free to message me.

61,"First I would like to thank Sophie for starting this website, and secondly thanks to all you very brave folks out there for sharing! When you 
have a problem like this, it is true, you never share it with anyone. But I had no idea this many people suffered from IBS.My Dad's side of the family suffers from stomach problems and anxiety. When I started going through my family history (getting answers was a little hard - like I didn't know my Dad had problems with anxiety until a couple years ago) I started feeling some emotional relief! I thought I was going nuts or having a breakdown of some kind.I have come to realize my IBS comes in conjunction with stress. I have talked to my GI doctor, and because colon cancer runs in the family I have a colonoscopy every 5 years. I have found that daily exercise, meditation (I read the Bible), and being open with my family about my anxiety and IBS has actually made me feel better. For years I never told anyone I was having panic attacks or IBS symptoms. I was highly embarrassed. But now that my family and friends know, I feel like a weight has been lifted.Right now I am going through a terrible time with the IBS. I have been under an amazing amount of stress. I talked with my GI doctor today about making an appointment to get on some drugs. I may still take the drugs, but from the past (I go through cycles of IBS) I know that it does eventually pass. I am working on eating better, avoiding foods that trigger symptoms, doing the Lactinex everyday, sticking to a more BRAT diet (banana, rice, apple sauce, toast) and working out.The other day my husband and I were walking around the neighborhood. I started to feel crampy and actually had to stop a couple times. I kept repeating to myself 'It's OK, if something happens I will be OK'. One of my greatest fear triggers is going on a long walk because I too lost my bowels. I was so mortified! But I try to decide every day that I can go on, I'll make it, everything is going to be OK. But some days are harder than others.For all the people who don't support you or understand you, God help them!

62,"I have been lactose intolerant since 1988 and I had the condition under control, meaning I could tolerate cheeses and ice creams. I had very little problems, if any, until February 2008. I'm a Nordic female of 42 years of age. Suddenly I got very ill and had episodes of diarrhea on and off. There was almost a pattern, I was fine for about six days and then I had a really bad case of D which lasted two or three days. My stool was never normal, it was either very soft or just runny (with some explosions mixed in).I went to see my GP and after stool and blood tests etc, I was diagnosed with IBS. I then went on the familiar route, by trying the Multibillion acidophilus, probiotic drinks, DiarSafe and the calcium carbonate treatment, which all seemed to work for about a week and then I would have another severe episode of the horrible D. It got so bad that I could not hold anything in, and all drinks and foods consumed would flush straight through me.After the last episode, having suffered diarrhea and bed-bound for two and a half days I have finally understood to leave ALL dairy out from my diet. This has completely changed my physical condition as after just 48 hours all symptoms of IBS had gone. Just like that.I can't believe how for so many years I could tolerate some dairy and then suddenly, out of the blue, this all changed?! Since February I had 
suffered with sinus and ear problems, nausea, terrible gas, grumbling intestines, tiredness, some dizziness, and insomnia to mention but a few. 
What can I say, I'm cured - life without any dairy starts from here.So to all of you fellow sufferers: please don't give up on trying to find a solution - there must be a reason for your condition and hopefully it is 
fixable.E-mail Nina:[email protected]",,condition,dairy,email,ice cream,food,lactose,start,insomnia,gas,nausea
63,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));My problems with IBS started when I was a teenager. I had the typical symptoms but they were generally fairly low-grade, for the most part they didn't interfere with my life to a great extent. I'm currently 26 years old, and a couple of years ago things started getting worse. I was getting light-headed and nauseous, and the worst part for me was the chills and diarrhea. This started to rear up when I was going to see friends, which was triggered by some anxiety, which after it happened once made me anxious about my stomach, which would upset it, and so a vicious circle was formed.From this it became to be a constant cycle of bloating, discomfort and diarrhea. I turned into a social recluse, spent nine months seeing a psychologist for anxiety with no great relief. I felt the only thing I could do that would help was to avoid social situations and try not to eat. I'd make myself sick if I felt I'd eaten too much to try and prevent the digestive consequences.Then I found this site. I read all of the stories in the Happy Tales section (for women with diarrhea) and it gave me the first positive feelings of hope I'd had in a long, long time. Armed with my new-found hope, I went back to the doctors and asked them how I could deal with my IBS (and related anxiety). What I got was 'Well if you think about itlogicallyyou have nothing to worry about', 'Just tell your friends you have stomach problems, they won't mind if you need to cut a night out short, they'll probably be tired anyway', 'You don't need to try an exclusion diet, you just need to work out what's setting you off' and finally 'Here have a leaflet'.So I walked out and spent 20 minutes crying in the doctors' car park. I seriously felt like going home and ending it all, there was no way I could contemplate living my life so restricted and just feeling awful all the time. After crying myself out and blubbing down the phone to my thankfully very supportive partner I thought 'You know what, it's obvious that the doctor isn't going to help me. So that just leaves me to help myself'.So I went to the shops and bought 600mg calcium carbonate tablets and some acidophilus. I also decided to try excluding things to find out where the problem lies, starting with the biggest - gluten. For me, it's been nothing short of a miracle. It's been about three weeks now of gluten-free plus the supplements. It's been pretty hard resisting the cravings for wheat/bread etc but after the first week they calmed down. My appetite in general has decreased and I feel much more satisfied by what I'm eating. I've not been bloated or gassy. I've not had crippling stomach pains, I've not felt sick and dizzy. And I've not had diarrhea!I am honestly so happy I could cry, and I have. I've been to see friends (admittedly a little tentatively at first) and it's been a resounding success. I've even signed up to take yoga classes, something I wouldn't have even considered before. I'm not saying the approach I'm taking will suit everyone, sadly as most people with IBS knows what suits one person doesn't always suit another. But for me it's amazing.And I just wanted to say thank you so much for a) coming up with this site and b) for everyone who has told their story. Without you I never would have started down this path.

65,I suffered from severe cramps and sudden onset beginning in my early 20s. Working full time was miserable. I ordered a book about IBS and read it cover to cover. From that book I took one snippet of information that has changed my life. Take fiber. I began by taking three or four fiber pills a day. Now I have increased fiber in my diet with my meals and I only take two or three fiber pills a day. I am now 31 years old and go about my day in confidence and in control.E-mail Sarah:[email protected],,book,pill,email,cramp,diet,meal,,,,
66,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I consider today to be my official diagnosis day. I've always had a sensitive stomach, and I used to think I had IBS-A when I would get my 
period...so I went on the continual pill and stopped getting my period and things were amazingly good for many, many years. Then I got food poisoning (so bad I had blood in my stool for the first time ever). The next day I went to Mexico for a week. In Mexico my stomach first got better, then worse. By the time I returned to Canada I had constant daily diarrhea.Two months later I was still having diarrhea almost every day (maybe one or two days a week without it). No alternating this time. My doctor did some tests for parasites and some blood tests to see if I was having an allergic reaction or an autoimmune reaction, and everything came back fine. I got a referral to a GI, but that took a few months since he put in his referral letter (and also told me in a very apologetic way) that he thought I had IBS.While waiting for my appointment (after I finally realized that this wasn't going to go away easily) I started reading peer-reviewed journal 
articles and medical textbooks. Man is there a lot that isn't known. Regardless, there are a number of GI specialists out there who don't believe 
that diarrhea-only IBS is actually a form of IBS (I don't get constipation at all, unless I accidentally overdo the Imodium).I held on to that belief for a long time. I didn't want to have IBS. Like so many of you I wanted something they could name and fix (fix being the important part). But over the months, while I waited for the appointment, I came to a realization. At this stage the name doesn't matter any more. If they call it IBS or idiopathic chronic diarrhea or some other name, it all means the same thing. There may be some underlying cause/parasite/bacteria/allergy, but at this point it's not something that they can easily test for and treat (considering all of the tests I've had). And so the practical reality is the same, regardless of the name. I need to manage the symptoms myself.And so I've taken the calcium carbonate and Benefiber. I've cut out all artificial sweeteners and almost all pop (I have the very rare glass). I've limited my alcohol intake (maybe a couple of glasses of wine every month, and definitely not all at once. I don't drink coffee or caffeinated tea, and I've cut out dairy. I've started relaxation training, and I have worked on prioritizing my life and decreasing my worries (not that I've seen a strong link with stress in my case, but it's a good idea regardless).With all of that I'm down to about two days of diarrhea a week, although I'm still getting a lot of stomach rumbles - the fiber is pretty new, and I think my gut is just getting used to that, and getting used to have solid bowel movements again. Today I had a flexible sigmoidoscopy, and while the doctor took a few biopsy samples, it looked perfectly fine except for a few small hemorrhoids which were causing the bleeding I've been having the last few months.So as of today it's OK. I'm not going to hide from it and I'm working on not being ashamed of it. I have IBS (or something that's close enough that it doesn't matter - funny how I still need that disclaimer). I don't like it, but I'm grateful that at this point it's become so controllable. I'll keep looking for things that will help, but at this point I'm just grateful for the stage things are at now.Oh, and a bit of warning for people with chronic diarrhea...if you take Citromag as a colon cleanser before a procedure like a sigmoidoscopy, don't be surprised if the effects just don't stop. I'm allowed to eat again, but the food is going straight through me (like it did when I first took the Citromag), and it's 24 hours later. I've kept the food simple, and I have taken some Imodium, so it's a bit better now...I think it'll take a few more doses to get this under control. So just drink plenty of liquids and don't get too surprised. I didn't find this as a 
side effect listed anywhere, but I should have guessed! I mean, it's the reason I was having the procedure in the first place.E-mail Jennifer:[email protected]",,stomach,exam,email,food,grateful,glass,glass,stage,appointment,blood
67,"I first started having symptoms of IBS when I was around 10 years old. I can see myself banging on the bathroom door in my old house begging whoever was in there to hurry up. I had cramping and diarrhea almost every day for 15 years. I can't ever remember having a solid bowel movement during that time.I never went to the doctor; I just assumed that being sick all of the time was part of who I was. Whenever I left the house, it was pretty much a given that I would need to run to the bathroom at some point. My friends and family knew this and factored it into plans. Sometimes they laughed about it, other times people would get annoyed, and one time my brother accused me of bringing it upon myself. That really hurt my feelings.I have endless tales of my experiences of IBS, such as going to the bathroom in the woods during the winter when I was 14 and having to wipe myself with a pillowcase when I car camped with my boyfriend. In addition to all of these wonderful memories, I've had the unfortunate experience of using some of the most disgusting bathrooms in the United States.One day several years ago I was puttering around in my kitchen and realized that I couldn't remember the last time I had diarrhea. I was so 
excited! For months I'd been having solid bowel movements and I had not realized how monumental that actually was. The reason I wasn't getting sick anymore was because I changed the kind of food I was buying. I stopped getting processed foods and bought fresh and organic foods. Instead of buying frozen meals in a bag, I cooked my meals. When it comes to packaged foods, if they have ingredients I can't pronounce, I don't buy them.This strategy has worked for me for almost four years. I still get sick on occasion, but it usually happens when I eat out. My experiences lead me to believe that there is some sort of chemical or preservative in processed foods that was making me sick.E-mail Carrie:[email protected]",,toilet,food,transformed food,home,email,meal,kind,kind,solid,kitchen

69,"eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I first developed acute symptoms of IBS when I was 11. In retrospect I know now that it was completely stress-related, having grown up in a very stressful and fearful home environment. My IBS is the type where I get severe intestinal cramps in waves as the diarrhea tries to work its way out. The cramps are so severe that I actually think I am going to pass out. I wonder if childbirth is more painful than this, does anyone have any experience of that to compare? I'm hoping that one bonus to come out of this is that I now have a ridiculously high pain threshold!I have never found the medical profession to be of much help at all with this illness. I was originally hospitalized at 11 for suspected Crohn's disease, but after exhaustive tests they could not find anything and half-heartedly mentioned IBS, which was very much in its infancy then. I was simply told to eat All Bran every morning! Over the years I developed the symptoms regularly, especially when in unhealthy relationships, and I suffered from extreme daily gas and colic. However after my experience with the doctors I didn't go back as I presumed they could not help.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I am definitely what you would call an emotional type and my IBS was always related to this, in that I was more susceptible to allergies from certain foods in stressful times. Also whenever I was afraid/anxious it would manifest directly in my stomach. However I've done a lot of healing work on myself over the past six years on an emotional, mental and spiritual level and my digestive problems have all but disappeared. Now the symptoms only reappear once or twice a year, mostly when I have been abroad, as every time I go abroad I get constipated and I come home with cramps for a few days from the change in diet. I have been prescribed mebeverine by my doctor which does help.I also get occasional mystery attacks which I really cannot identify or link to anything - although I do know that I am wheat and especially dairy intolerant. In those situations I just have to rule out any new food that I've been eating and my rule of thumb is to throw away anything that is suspect. Interestingly I have also developed acute allergies in the last six years, such as to nuts, seeds, grass and bleach. These are all triggered especially if I am stressed, and I then need an epipen.So I do wonder if perhaps I am the type of individual who has been traumatized as a child, and so my body is hyper-vigilant for any irritant or any substance it perceives as a threat? My allergy doctor did also say that it is hereditary to have a malfunctioning immune system where it is overly vigilant - again I do wonder if this is linked, as my IBS seems to be a response to something in my gut it perceives as a threat.Anyhow since I have focused on my emotional healing through 12-step groups and therapy I rarely ever get IBS attacks and when I do it is 
directly from a food my gut is allergic too. I rarely have to take medication, I eat very healthily, I don't drink alcohol or coffee, I eat little sugar. I do eat dairy but I have to be careful. I'm very aware of my life choices and how much stress I invite into my life.I hope this gives you hope. I am now 34 years old and my life is very manageable and my stomach is very happy most of the time.

70,"I was diagnosed with IBS about a year ago now and at times it has been hell to live with. I already knew a little about IBS which sort of helped when diagnosed as my Dad suffers too. I don't know how and when it started but a couple of years ago I suffered a bout of gastroenteritis and I think since then it lay dormant, but in June 2007 whilst on holiday in Florida it seemed to come alive.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));The last few days of my holiday were horrible and upon returning to the UK I didn't seem to be getting any better. I chose to ignore it and hope it went away, but it didn't and eventually I ended up seeing my doctor who took some stool samples and found nothing wrong and basically said it was IBS. For the next nine or 10 months it was a nightmare, I constantly had a 'bad stomach' as I put it, and found it hard attending classes, which wasn't good considering I was in my final year at university.It eventually got to the stage that I wouldn't leave the house for the fear of having an attack. I often got so anxious about leaving the house 
that I began to panic and just freak out, and if I managed to get out I was just desperate to go home again. There were times I wasn't leaving the house for weeks at a time, apart from going into the garden at most. I used to take loperamide constantly but then it would make me constipated so I couldn't win either way. I also tried probiotic drinks which turned out to make my IBS worse, and so I tried multivitamin probiotic tablets which didn't help either.I also tried peppermint oil capsules but these just made me feel sick and were no help and so I stopped taking them. I was desperate for it all to go away, I just wanted to be 'normal' again. I then sat one afternoon and trawled through website after website of different things IBS sufferers have tried to relieve their symptoms, and I came across a herbal remedy called slippery elm bark.At first I thought it sounded awful but then again I was willing to try anything, and so I looked through health food shops until I found it. For the last two months or so I have taken three capsules a day, with my breakfast, lunch and dinner (the capsules can also be opened and poured into a glass of water) and I am pleased to say I have never felt better since my symptoms first started.I now work full-time and although I still get a 'bad stomach' in the mornings I am able to just ignore it and get on with the day. I can even 
walk around the shops without rushing and without wanting to go home straight away. I still take loperamide every now and then but mainly just in case and far less than I used to. I don't get as anxious when I leave the house anymore, but just in case I carry a rescue remedy spray in my bag which helps to calm my nerves. I am not saying that slippery elm bark has cured my IBS because I know that it can never be completely eradicated, but I have found that so far it has worked for me.In addition to slippery elm I have found that caffeine is a no-go area for me, but then again I never liked tea or coffee so that helped in cutting 
it out of my diet. I have cut down on dairy; I still have it in my diet but just not so much, and every now and then I cut dairy out of my diet 
completely for about two weeks before slowly reintroducing it again. I also find that little things like nuts etc don't seem to agree with me anymore 
either and neither does fish, but I just keep an eye on what I eat and can sort of judge what my stomach can handle and what it can't.I recommend slippery elm bark to anyone who is looking to try something which is natural and who is desperate like I was for some relief. I also find that this website is a great help as it shows we IBS sufferers are not alone and there is at least one person out there who knows how you feel.E-mail Victoria:[email protected]",,home,capsule,website,bark,stomach,diet,dairy,email,remedy,holiday
71,"Hi there. I came across this website as I was googling diarrhea/abdominal pains/effects of eating cream/milk. I am so pleased I did! I had one of my episodes at 2.15am, about nine hours ago. I am 55 and I am not sure if I have IBS but I have suffered sporadic episodes where I have acute abdominal cramping followed by acute diarrhea since I was a child! I can remember being rushed to the doctor or having him come to the house and being given morphine for the pain as a teenager! However these episodes would occur and then I would be perfectly well, have normal bowel movements and not experience another for months or even years at a time.I have seen a gastroenterologist and had proctoscopes inserted, but no-one has been able to say exactly what causes the attacks. However I did start to notice I seemed to get an attack after eating creamy foods or garlic and would avoid them and also full cream milk. Also as I got older the pain would be so intense I usually passed out whilst on the toilet and came around on the floor! I have called an ambulance but by the time they came I was already on the loo.I usually am awoken by the stomach pain and cramping and then think 'Oh no here we go!' I know that I will usually start off trying to 
have a bowel movement and this will happen and quickly proceed to abrupt noisy and explosive diarrhea over and over until I am completely empty. I usually am bathed in perspiration and am as white as a ghost.Lately (over the past few years) I often vomit at the same time and as I say often pass out too. The time before last about six months ago my husband and I were staying overnight at a hotel and I'd eaten a rich dessert. I awoke about 2am and experienced all of the above but then found myself on the floor in a pool of blood! I'd fainted and fallen forward cutting my right eyebrow on the edging where the bathroom tile finished and the room carpeting began. I ended up with three stitches above my eye. I then am extremely tired and freezing cold finding it hard to get warm.Yesterday I must admit I had consumed quite a lot of skim milk in drinks and also had some chewy lollies and low fat ice cream for dessert. I am a Weight Watchers lifetime member and exercise daily plus watch what I eat so wonder if this is perhaps why my attacks are so sporadic? Who knows! However I was interested to read in some of your members' tales that stress seems to be related. I was told a couple of weeks ago that I am being retrenched from my job. A new system is being introduced and it will automate most of the work I and three of my colleagues do, so in about six months we will be let go.I have been feeling stressed because of this and not sleeping very well, and also the fact that I have not yet shared this with my husband as he is in the UK visiting his ailing Mum. I chose not to tell him prior to his departure as I knew it would ruin his trip and he would worry about things, money etc. I thought I was handling it OK but now think maybe not so well!

I can relate to most all of the stories I've read on this site, including the ones where people suffer from the anxiety of having to go somewhere where there may not be a suitable bathroom available, never knowing when pain's going to strike, people's misunderstanding of how you feel, having to construct makeshift porta-potties for the road, etc.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));I'm a musician/singer, and have had times where I've actually had to leave the stage mid-performance because I was interrupted by severe pain and had to go right now! Plus I'm on the road for so many hours with no bathroom. I was not officially diagnosed until about a year ago. My IBS was masked by other issues like my severe endometriosis, and resulting large endometrioma, which led to the need for a complete hysterectomy.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));This made me feel a lot better, but didn't solve my intestinal cramping, pain and diarrhea. Then, just last year, I went through five months of extreme nausea, lost 30 pounds from being so sick and having horrible diarrhea all the time, and found out my gallbladder simply wasn't functioning fully (no stones or anything like that). So I got that removed. It didn't help any IBS symptoms, but got rid of the nausea.The good part is that before my gallbladder was removed, I was living on an occasional spoonful of plain yogurt and a cracker or two each day. So when I had the surgery and had come through the recovery period, I tried incorporating yogurt into my diet on a regular basis. I have found that if I eat a container of yogurt before I eat anything else, it drastically improves how my body reacts to the food. I have experienced less bloating, less pain, less diarrhea, and am finally feeling like I have at least some control over how I feel. A two-week-long stretch of regular bowel activity is nothing less than thrilling after all these years!eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Bear in mind, I still have to avoid things which I know bother me, like beef and lettuce to name a couple. In addition, I have experimented with many different kinds of yogurts and have found that some brands or varieties have much less of a positive effect than others, and I think the Activia stuff actually made me very sick (it was way too painful to try it again just to confirm my suspicions!).To date, the yogurt that works best for me is Yoplait regular! (red and white container). The light version (blue and white container) of Yoplait didn't work nearly as well for me, for some reason. It's great - I can eat any variety of the regular Yoplait, and get the same benefits, regardless of the flavor I choose. Plus, Yoplait now offers a family pack, which brings down the cost per unit, for bulk yogurt buyers like me.It has really changed my outlook, and has removed some of my anxiety, letting me feel more in control of how I feel than before. I would recommend that IBS sufferers try eating two to four yogurts a day, especially about 15 minutes before meals. I also have a yogurt right after I wake up, to start the day off right. If I forget to eat yogurt on any given day, before the day is over, I will have diarrhea which usually takes about 
two or three days and plenty more yogurt to get rid of. If you're going to do it you must be consistent! Best wishes to you all! I feel you, man!E-mail Mandie:[email protected]",,yoghourt,pain,container,email,people,anxiety,toilet,nausea,white,regular

I have spent tons of money on medication, vitamins, books and some of it kind of helped but I was still having a lot of intestinal pain, constipation, bloating, gas, acid reflux, muscle tightness, dermatitis and diarrhea. Then my brain started to malfunction. My breathing was freezing up, and I would have to force myself to breathe. It felt like sleep apnea.I decided to go to the IBS treatment center in Seattle, Washington. They tested me for food allergies, parasites, bacteria, yeast, and some other stuff, and they found lots of issues. I had pinworms, candida, bad bacteria, c. difficile and numerous food allergies. My body was so out of whack. I did go to a naturopath and they did a skin-prick test for food allergies but there was a discrepancy.It is expensive but worth it. The IBS treatment center figured out the problem within a couple of months. But you have to be committed to get off a lot of certain foods but I almost feel like a normal person now. No more brain issues. I still have some issues to resolve but I'm on the road to recovery. Don't give up, there are good doctors out there.E-mail Kathy:[email protected]",,food,allergy,doctor,email,bacterium,center,center,center,treatment,brain
74,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I am from the UK and thought you might like to share my story. I was a fit and seemingly healthy person until my gallbladder was removed in 1993, and after this my years of misery began. I was unwell for about a year after this and eventually IBS and GERD were diagnosed. At this stage the IBS was inconvenient but did not impinge radically on my life, but I had to plan all outings carefully and make sure I did not eat if I was going to be out for more than an hour after the meal.I managed, but in 1997 I was diagnosed with Graves' disease (Thyroid) which was treated with radioactive iodine. After this I had a massive range of symptoms which were all put down to my thyroid medication being uncontrolled, despite all results being OK. My IBS went into overdrive and caused me so much stress that I had to give up my career years earlier than I had intended. From being an extrovert and outgoing person I turned into one with irrational fears and stayed more or less confined to my home. My husband has stuck by me through all this.One of the most distressing side effects was severe pain in every inch of my body. I was tested for all sorts of severe problems including MS and nothing was found. To cut a long story short I moved to another area of the country and instead of being told I was a hypochondriac or suffering from a variety of syndromes for which there was no cure, I was taken seriously by my new GP, who referred me to a consultant rheumatologist who listened to my story and took one look at me and immediately said that she thought I was suffering from a vitamin D deficiency. After tests she rang me to tell me that my vitamin D level was the lowest she had ever seen (8nmol, normal is 50-140nmol).I started treatment last month, starting with a booster injection and continuing with daily Calcichew tablets. I have also taken wheat out of my diet because I need to lose seven stone (all the comfort eating at home). My IBS has already improved out of recognition and I have spent my first full day out in 12 years without having to worry about the proximity of toilets etc. Also my aches and pains are lessening. I now know there is a link between IBS and vitamin D in my case - believe it or not all my other symptoms are disappearing and I am starting to regain my energy.What a pity the doctors spent so much time and money on investigating more serious illnesses when a simple vitamin d test years ago would have sorted out my problems. Also I would not have had to retire early with a radically reduced pension. I feel I have lost years of my life but at least I can now enjoy my retirement. It is well worth asking your doctor to check your vitamin D levels if you have unspecified aches and pains and IBS just to rule it in or out.If your level has got very low you may need more than the supplements sold over the counter in chemists. Multivitamins often don't contain vitamin D and you would need to eat the equivalent of about 10 tins of oily fish a week to get the missing vitamin d from your diet. This is especially true if you live in the northern hemisphere where there is insufficient sunlight in winter to top you up. Good luck to everyone who is trying to find a solution for IBS - I was looking for the solution to other problems and my IBS virtually disappearing has been a very welcome bonus for me.Update on S...I did not realize how much IBS (let alone the other symptoms) had ruled my life until the treatment of vitamin D deficiency kicked in and I realized that the treatment is still working. My IBS has for the most part gone. No more severe griping pains after meals and at other spurious times. No more carrying spare underwear if I plucked up the courage to leave home, no more room deodorizer in the handbag, no more...well, you get the picture without me going into the graphic detail most of you are familiar with.The best thing is being able to go out and enjoy myself without fear of embarrassment. I can now plan holidays, outings and above all look forward to the birth of my first grandchild without giving a thought to the dreaded IBS. Although I do not have celiac disease I have also removed wheat from my diet as I found it made me bloated, but it is the vitamin D problem that was making my IBS intolerable.By the way I now eat at least five to six portions of fresh fruit and veg every day, protein, fat (to help the absorption of vitamin d) and carbohydrate in the form of corn crackers. All the fruit and veg I eat is uncooked. I eat 1500 calories a day, do not feel hungry and I have lost over two stone (28 pounds) in two months without surgery but with mild aerobic exercise, so this is a bonus to my IBS disappearing (I do need to lose another four stone put on by feeling sorry for myself). Perhaps I should write a diet book! I haven't the time now I am going out so much!I know that there are many reasons for IBS and how debilitating it is. Until you suffer from it you do not realize how unpleasant an illness it is. And believe me, when it goes away it is the greatest feeling in the world. I am not sure that I will never suffer from IBS again but it's wonderful to be rid of it for the moment. I can now get my life back on track.Good luck to all sufferers - I hope you also get relief from this unpleasant, painful and life-sapping ailment! No-one deserves this illness, it just grinds you down. I know - I nearly topped myself at my lowest ebb. Only the support of my family kept me going. Unfortunately I did not find this site until this year and would have benefited from it. IBS suffering can be a very lonely place without support.

75,"I just came across this site, and I am so happy to be reading all the stories about IBS, I always felt I must be the only one with this dreadful debilitating problem. I had my first colonoscopy in 1992 and have had several since. It has almost ruined my life, and never being able to go very far, especially in the morning, is the worst.I am 62 now and in four weeks my husband and I will be taking a long road trip. I have been so anxious about it, wondering what I will do in 
traffic with no restrooms around. My husband doesn't seem to understand either, saying 'Why do you need to go again?' I have cried over this as it is an awful way to live.I saw my GP today and she has given me Lomotil, which gave me hope after reading positive reports from those who have IBS. I can't wait to try them tomorrow to see how I go. I also had my gallbladder removed 39 years ago and I have never been the same after that with bowel problems. My 35 year-old son had his removed three years ago and also suffers the same.

76,"When I was four months pregnant my gallbladder was removed due to stones when I had surgery for a suspected Crohn's disease attack (ended up being an adhesion which was strangling my bowel). I was fine for the remainder of my pregnancy but after I gave birth that's when the severe diarrhea began. Mostly in the morning, about four times. I was 37, I couldn't leave home (especially in the morning) and depression set in. I had osteopenia in my hips (from calcium deficiency) and so on. Life sucked!Finally after about a year I got referred to a gastro specialist who told me straight away it was bile salt diarrhea and subscribed Questran Light. Fantastic! It took about two days to work. Why can't they tell you this could be a possible side effect of gallbladder removal? It could've saved me from a lot of stress and post-natal depression!I'm now 41 and I take Questran Light still, a low dose of an anti-depressant (Effexor - also great), calcium and other vitamins. Life is now good. I didn't know Questran depleted the uptake of vitamins though which was why my iron levels became so low maybe? Thanks to this site I have become more informed.

Awful gas pain, feeling like I had to go 24/7 even when I didn't, hours and hours in the bathroom...The only thing I found to be effective was actually bringing my weight down. I started working out and went from around 220lbs to 170lbs and the IBS just disappeared.I wasn't mega-obese or anything but I am 100% sure that my IBS was directly related to the extra weight my body was dealing with, as I injured my knee two years ago and have now gained a lot of the weight back. I'm up to 200lbs again and guess what?

78,"I was recently diagnosed with chronic (severe) IBS with diarrhea. For almost three years I suffered bad cramping, diarrhea where I would go to the bathroom 10 to 15 times a day several days a week, constant stomach irritation and heavy menstrual bleeding. I finally thought it was due to PMS stuff so I went to a new OBGYN who told me of a newer procedure called Novasure that would take care of the diarrhea from PMS and stop my monthly bleeding, so I said yes - anything to stop the diarrhea and cramping.Well, that worked for four months, but then I was right back to the same pain and diarrhea. I went back to the OBGYN and was told there was nothing I could do but take Aleve for the pain and go home. For another year I suffered until I couldn't take the pain anymore.I found an internal specialist who did a lot of testing and x-rays, an upper GI, blood tests (mostly to rule out things) and after weeks of testing she said I suffered from chronic (severe) IBS with diarrhea. She prescribed dicyclomine which has helped me tremendously. I still get attacks but not as many as before. PMS does trigger my attacks more than anything else.I am in the process of learning what my trigger foods are and trying to limit my stress. Stress is a big trigger for me - I do go to a chiropractor monthly which also helps to relax me. Of course, there is no cure and lifestyle change is a must with this condition.I continue to take daily medication and I am glad I went to an internal specialist who took my symptoms seriously.

79,"I have suffered from IBS for most of my adult life. It was awful, especially during my 20s when all of my friends were out enjoying themselves. Most food and drink upset me, and it was very difficult. Since I was a young child I've had mild eczema and itchy, dry skin. Last year I had to have a mole removed from my skin. The dermatologist asked me about my skin etc and prescribed an anti-histamine to stop the itch. She prescribed cetirizine 10mg once a day, taken before bedtime to stop my scratching in the night.At first it made me very drowsy in the mornings, and so drowsy that the IBS early morning rush started to improve. The drowsiness was beginning to affect me though, so I decided to switch to a different anti-histamine tablet, but unfortunately the IBS returned.I now take two cetirizine 10mg tablets every night before bed, and the IBS has gone completely! I can actually now eat what I like, even fish and chips, with no effects whatsoever! I've started to gain weight now and have put on nearly a stone due to the lift on my restricted diet. Cetrizine does make some people drowsy, especially me, but I'm learning to live with it, and it's a small price to pay for being IBS-free and eating and drinking what you like. I'm like a kid in a sweet shop at the moment, enjoying so many foods and drinks, and feeling healthier and happier.You can buy cetirizine over the counter, you don't need a prescription. I need two a day, but you may find you need either one or three, it just depends. I told my doctor about it and she is very excited and will be suggesting it to other IBS patients. My understanding is that cetirizine is classed as an anti-allergy drug, so if, like me, you are sensitive to many foods and drinks this could be the answer.Cetirizine is used a lot for seasonal allergies like hayfever etc, and also pet hair allergies. Brand names if you buy over the counter in the UK are Zirtek and Piritize. I really hope this helps some people.

81,"I just wanted to pass on this information, to hopefully help any of you fellow sufferers that have similar stories to mine. I have had IBS with awful pain and diarrhea for over 18 years. I've seen numerous consultants and had all the usual tests and been told to get on with it and take codeine phosphate to control the pain. I'd typically go about an average of nine times a day and feel constantly tired.About a year ago I went back to my GP again following a really bad six months and he referred me to an IBS center of research in Manchester. I tried every tablet going to control my IBS (including each brand of anti-spasmodics and low dose anti-depressants) and had a whole new set of tests done. Still nothing worked!I fortunately saw a a doctor who sent me for a nuclear medicine abdominal scan (SeHCAT test) and it turns out I have not got IBS-D but I have bile salt malabsorption. Because I don't absorb my bile salts they leak into my large intestine and cause pain and diarrhea. My consultant was really shocked as I have no history of surgery on my bowel or my gallbladder.I have now had my first month of Questran sachets and I have not had any diarrhea for the first time in 18 years. I can't tell you how blissful it is to have my life back and not be running to the loo all day. Also to have some sort of medical answer. Apparently it's quite rare to have it, but with so many people being diagnosed with IBS I'm wondering if it's not more common than the doctors think?

82,"After years of suffering from IBS (I'm now 47 and I have suffered for 25 years - just generally unwell, lethargic and tired continually) I finally identified a major cause for me: wheat and caffeine allergy/intolerance. I'm surprised it took so long for me to identify these problem foods as I have an NHS medical background! I now strictly adhere to the diet and this leaves me really well. An added benefit has been that I now have no asthma symptoms or hypoglycemia. Both disappeared within two weeks!Within a month of first going on to the diet I had problems with terrible nausea, stomach aches and diarrhea. I felt especially unwell first thing in the morning. I cured this with ginger and turmeric tea every morning (one teaspoon of ginger, one of turmeric, two teaspoons of honey to sweeten and one tablespoon of lemon juice). It works an absolute treat in 20 minutes flat to relieve all the symptoms. I gather it works so well because it is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory. I have to say I was very skeptical when I first tried it as I have tried dozens of so-called remedies, none of which worked. This one really does work and has made a tremendous difference to my wellbeing.I have also now slowly increased my soluble fiber intake using psyllium. I now feel very, very well.

I am 44 and have always taken very good care of myself as I am really into nutrition, exercise and overall taking care of myself. After many tests, extensive blood work, MRIs, a CT scan, and an endoscopy that found non-cancerous polyps that apparently shouldn't be causing any pain, I was beyond frustrated. The GI doctor only wanted to give me medicines that I researched and knew were not for me after looking at the side effects and possible long-term effects.I finally went to a naturopath who is also chiropractor. He sent five vials of blood off to a lab for a delayed reaction onset allergy testing that is not normally covered under insurance - but I was desperate. The test results say that I am very allergic to corn! Also about 22 other things, but this was the severe one.The naturopath told me that my immune system was overloaded. As a child I had a lot of eczema and skin reactions. I was also told that the polyps could become cancerous if I didn't get them under control. I have to say I was very skeptical but I decided to try the suggested program and see what would happen.I had to take several supplements during the day and avoid what I was allergic to for the next six months, then start introducing the foods back in slowly and only occasionally.

85,"I've had anxiety-induced IBS (IBS-D I guess) for as far back as I can remember, probably from about nine years old (I'm 47 now). One doctor suggested a psychiatrist who kept asking me what I was thinking; all I was thinking of was the pain in my gut and wanting to get out of there to use the loo! I have had panic attacks because of the cramps and feeling of losing control.My IBS can turn on and off when it likes though, for example we were out walking at night once and it was all I could do to hang on, sweating panic attacks and all, and the minute we walked in the back door all disappeared. Seems to be a security blanket if there's a loo nearby, if not all hell breaks loose! Makes me so mad! I felt like I was nuts!After having a teary breakdown at the doctors two years ago I was put on Aropax tabs, together with Colofac, and I have had a 99% change. The doctor then suggested a colonoscopy and endoscopy (I also had some reflux, which has settled since a course of Somac) which showed nothing. I didn't even get nervous because of the meds, I thought I'd be a mess. I was going to the loo after breakfast every morning, nice and regular.Then I was diagnosed with type two diabetes and put on cholesterol tabs which have slightly constipated me, not badly though.

86,"A few years ago I was diagnosed as hyperinsulimic. I was told to cut potatoes, bread, rice - starches, basically - and sugar, and lose 10% of my body weight pronto. IBS was a given with me - I'm 48 now, 45 at the time of the hyperinsulimic diagnosis - and I've had IBS since I was 15. I didn't go anywhere without Bentyl, which caused its own set of problems. You take it, you're good to go, but then if you take it for a week or more, say on vacation where I'd take four to six a day, at the end of the week you'd be terribly sick with an attack because you hadn't really gone to the bathroom normally. Big catch-22 and horrid merry-go-round. But it was my life.Then I got the hyperinsulimic diagnosis and my mom got ill at around the same time. I decided to go on basically an Atkins diet, with vegetables and the occasional low carb tortilla, because I could not afford to be sick myself when I had to take care of my mother in various hospitals. To my extreme surprise, the IBS vanished. Stress had always been a big trigger for me, and believe me, the four months my mom was ill were a hugely stressful time for me - and no attacks.I remembered, then, that I had read once that some people who suffer with IBS can't digest carbs properly. I know it worked for me. That was three years ago, and I've had maybe 10 attacks, and they were brought on by my own ignorance in eating bread and pasta, which I dearly love and miss, but not enough to go back to for good.It sounds melodramatic to say that this gave me my life back, but it's the truth. I was unable to do many things because I couldn't do things spur of the moment; I hadn't had time to take my meds and let them work. I had started having panic attacks and not being able to be in crowds or in a car with someone else, simply because of the fact that I knew I had to have bathrooms all the time, and felt trapped if I wasn't 'in charge'.

87,"I wanted to share my IBS story with other sufferers. I found this website and it's an absolute gift. I was a happy, healthy girl, bit of a worrier but never sick. It all started about three years ago when my life started to fall apart. My uncle died in early 2007. I was in a car accident going to work, and my aunt's house burned down. This was coupled with being moved to a different area in work where one girl went out of her way to make my life a misery, my Dad who has a degenerative disorder developed depression, and other family problems.In May 2008, one afternoon in work I had the worst case of diarrhea. I would go to the bathroom and I would only be back at my desk and I would have to go again. I was sweating and nauseous. I worked in an open-plan office and I was so embarrassed walking by people's desks every few minutes. I left work at 4pm and thought it was just a stomach upset.Worse was to come when at the end of the month my boyfriend broke up with me saying he didn't love me anymore after four and a half years, which broke my heart. As we were overseas when this happened, after I came home I tried to keep busy through work and friends. I started feeling sick after everything I ate and the diarrhea I was getting was bad. I would be in work early so at that stage it was easy to hide it from colleagues as it would be over before other people would arrive in.In September 2008 I went to the first doctor as the diarrhea was getting harder to hide in work and the cramps were something else. I got a lot of tests done and an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed up nothing but the blood test showed I had had glandular fever sometime in the last six months. So the doctor told me that I had a very bad case of IBS as celiac disease was ruled out and to manage as best as possible. I was told to try to cut down on stress as this seemed to be a major problem with me.As the weeks went by I was in and out to the doctor and I was prescribed Motilium around Christmas which was no help. Back I went to the doctors' surgery and I saw a different doctor. He said as this was going on too long to see a consultant in March 2009 (my first of four). She told me I could be lactose intolerant and to try to stay off dairy. This helped at first and the diarrhea settled a bit.Then it started up again. It was explosive and could be at anytime of the day which was draining. In work the area I worked in had moved to a different floor and it could take anything up to five minutes to get to the bathroom. Even going out socially was a nightmare as I could eat very little on the menu. Anywhere I went to I had to know where the toilet was before I could relax. So my social life was suffering too.The worst event for me was when we had a special lunch in work. I ordered a panini with chicken and ham. Within half an hour I was running to the bathroom and nearly didn't make it, and from that day I couldn't hide my problem from other people. I am a shy person so it was my worst nightmare. I was sweating and the room was spinning. I managed to hold on until 4pm and then left. After this I was losing weight, I went down to seven stone 13 pounds from nine and a half stone. I went to see an acupuncturist who was a great help and my weight went up to eight stone.I went back to my doctor and in the intervening months was prescribed Colpermin and Buscopan. In November of last year I had an endoscope and colonoscopy, which is not a pleasant procedure at all. At the end of November one Saturday night I got a shocking pain in my stomach with vomiting and diarrhea at the same time. This went on till 3am.In getting my results in December I was talking to the consultant's registrar who treated me with disdain. I was told 'We are running out of tests for you' and 'You are one of the many people the medical profession may be unable to find a cure for'. They did find a leaky polyp in my stomach which was removed. He prescribed amitriptyline which I was told would make me feel better. He never told me this was an anti-depressant and I was never depressed so I didn't take them. He also prescribed Colofac which was full of lactose! After seeing the consultant's registrar I felt very disillusioned and upset with the way I was treated, and I was being offered no help.In February of this year I ended up getting a horrible pain in my back which felt like my spine was going to snap. I went back again to my doctor who told me an ultrasound was a waste of time. After saying to him I wanted one he wrote me a letter to get the ultrasound privately. On 15 February the ultrasound showed up a diseased gallbladder and two gallstones which have to be removed.On talking to my own doctor after being diagnosed he told me I will still have IBS but it won't be to the extent that I did have it. Between February and the present time I have been in and out of work (I'm lucky I have a great, understanding boss). I ended up having gastric flu in May and I got my gallbladder removed a little while ago, so presently I am recuperating.My doctor was right, I still do have IBS, and I have started my food diary again. It is not as bad though and I am coping very well. I still have a bit of diarrhea in the morning but I can live with it. I can have a little dairy now (how I missed ice cream!) but I can't have a lot of it in one day. Pasta just causes my stomach to go crazy and brings on the diarrhea, wind, bloating and the 'creaky pipes' (noisy stomach).I am a happier person starting my 30s and I am looking forward to the future - starting a course, going traveling, buying a house, maybe meeting a new boyfriend, the list is endless. I hope this will show other people that it will get better and more manageable. A doctor is there is listen so keep talking until they hear you!

88,"I've been suffering from IBS since an attack when I was 19. There were incidents before that, but nothing regular. I had intense pain from a gassy stomach in college, but by far the worst was the unexpected IBS attacks that would just jump me out of nowhere. I would go very cold and then it was like thousands of needles were trying to puncture their way out of the lower part of my colon.Through the years I may have exacerbated my condition because I would try to 'clean' myself out before I left the house, using coffee, soda and anything with caffeine until they had no effect. Even taking psyllium husk only helped for the first week. So pain with alternating constipation and diarrhea was what I had to put up with every day. I didn't understand why this was happening to me.I went to all good schools and I thought I'd be doing things to help the world. Instead, worrying about my digestive system turned into panic attacks. Couldn't this problem hit only the bad people like terrorists and leave regular and good people alone?My family called it my chronic 'bad habit'. They were never very understanding to begin with, but surprisingly, one day my brother sent me info about endometriosis. For anyone with intense pain during periods and IBS symptoms (as well as other symptoms) endometriosis can be a factor.I was also diagnosed with Hashimoto nodules four years ago. Truthfully, from the research I've been doing, I think doctors should check for this earlier. The doctor just noticed a goiter was forming so he sent me in for testing.When I finally got the MRI my thyroid was like a mashed-up sponge. I was getting worse. Just going out for a 20-minute walk resulted in exhaustion. I would go to the city for a day and the next day I couldn't get out of bed. My body did this to itself. The only way most doctors test for hypothyroidism is with a blood test on the TSH levels, which I think is insufficient.  Since I've been on thyroid replacement medicine my digestive system has more or less come back to normal.There are also links to low thyroid levels and anxiety and depression. And more and more people are getting diagnosed with thyroid problems.  I have more research to back up my theory but it's too much to put here. Putting all these facts together, I started to think, what if a problem with the thyroid is a cause of IBS in most people? Since mostly women have IBS, and many of them have an onset after having children (right after birth a woman's thyroid can get a bit wonky), and of course the thyroid heavily affects metabolism, should people with IBS be asking the doctor to check out their thyroid?The regular medical practitioners brush off everything as all in your head when in actuality they either don't have the time or don't make the effort to learn more about the continuing medical research.

89,"I have just stumbled on this site and have found a lot of comfort in reading other people's stories and felt like telling mine. I hope it can help others. I have been diagnosed with IBS for some years. I had bouts of severe constipation, pain and intermittent diarrhea. The pain was so severe that I'd have to sleep with a hot water bottle on my stomach.A couple of years ago my IBS reached nightmare proportions. I developed severe diarrhea 20 to 30 times a day. My doctor just dismissed me with the same old IBS diagnosis. I was so desperate as my condition meant I needed to consider giving up my job. I felt my life was over. My toenails dropped off due to the inevitable loss of nutrition and I discovered that I had also developed early osteoporosis. All tests showed nothing, which, the doctors told me, meant IBS. I was a mess.A kind gastroenterologist, in response to my desperation, decided to try one more test. A hydrogen breath test revealed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and also showed I could no longer absorb fructose and lactose. I need to follow a no fructose (which is in wheat, fruit and sugar-free products) no lactose diet, which has greatly helped me - but is so hard. I also need to regularly go on antibiotics, when my symptoms get out of control. For my condition, antibiotics are magic. When I am on them I can eat like a normal person.SIBO apparently can be caused by other conditions, such as thyroid conditions, scleroderma, MS etc. The problem doesn't go away, unless the condition that causes bacteria to proliferate in the wrong spot (the intestine) can be corrected. I am not happy that I can't eat like other people, or that I need to regularly use antibiotics - but I thank God that I have finally been diagnosed and can lead a more normal life.

90,"I recently had a colonoscopy for pain and sensitivity in my lower left quadrant. The diagnosis was IBS (what else?). My husband wanted to discuss food allergies with the doc post-procedure and was politely shut up. After all, the bias was IBS. I had gone gluten-free and dairy-free two weeks before the procedure, so I was already healing from inflammation, so the doc could not see evidence of a food allergy.Weeks later, my gluten, peanut and dairy-free diet changed my life. I am symptom-free and I cannot believe the cognitive difference. Eastern medicine just doesn't cover symptoms, it gets down to the cause.

They wanted to do surgery for a hiatal hernia. I got scared and didn't. After a three-month sinus infection I went to an allergist. She found out I was allergic to wheat. I stopped eating wheat and had no reflux, no joint pain, I feel great, and the weight fell off. Wheat is so altered, they expect so few people to be able to tolerate wheat in the future.

92,"I had 30 years of doctors saying it was IBS. Nothing really worked. Diets, pills, supplements, whatever was out there I was willing to try it. Nothing was 100% and I always ended up with a flare-up. A friend suggested gluten-free products. After a lot of research I decided to give it a try. Sure enough, my body responded favorably. I had 30 days of pure normalcy - something I have not had in years. I decided to test my system and had a roll, and 24 hours later I was sick with diarrhea and stomach cramps.The doctor tells me that it may not be 100% celiac, but I am gluten sensitive. I am sure I will have flare-ups now and then as gluten is hidden in a lot of things. But before you give up try gluten-free, you should start to feel better within a few days. Give yourself 30 days, although most info says it could take a few months for your body to fully start to heal.

I was negative for celiac disease but found out I was positive for wheat and gluten intolerance based on genetic (DNA) testing.

94,"I began having digestion problems 40 years ago at age 14. I have always had problems with either diarrhea or constipation, and 25 years ago IBS was added to the list of diagnoses. Over the past year I became lactose and egg-allergic, and I was also unable to digest meat without pain. Eight months ago I needed to become vegan, but I still had bowel problems. The cutting, stabbing stomach and abdominal pain and bloating remained although it was slightly better.Then 28 days ago I went gluten-free, and slowly my overall health has moved forward. I still have fatigue but less abdominal problems. Seven days ago I added L-glutamine to my supplement regimen. Each day I notice overall improvements with my bowel health and less bloating. Bowel movements are not yet 'normal' but I only go two or three times a day with no cramping. This is better than up to nine times daily with distress.

95,"For a decade I have needed increasing time in bed to get enough sleep. My internist tried a few things but couldn't figure out why. The local sleep doc couldn't figure out any cause and neither could the Mayo sleep doc. Then God told me that I had celiac disease so I stopped eating wheat and went from needing 18 hours in bed to needing 12 or 13. Even after six months on a gluten-free diet I was still needing about 12 hours in bed each day.At the end of December 2010 my friend suggested that I might have an intestinal yeast infection and I went on the candida diet: basically no sugar, grains or starchy vegetables. This helped some but I still needed 12 hours in bed. I found that my GI system doesn't like grains or starchy vegetables even after yeast infection had healed and I went on the specific carbohydrate diet, the original GI-healing diet on which all of the others are based; see the book Breaking the Vicious Cycle. There are also web resources for SCD recipes. I saw signs that I may not tolerate fructose, but this wasn't enough, though.I went to a GI doc at Mayo who ordered all sorts of nasty tests, only to tell me that there was nothing structurally wrong with my GI system and give me a diagnosis of IBS. IBS isn't supposed to cause weight loss or disrupted sleep and I was stuck at 12 hours in bed to get eight hours of sleep. I searched the web and told all my friends about my problems. People suggested recording everything I ate, totally fasting, and going on a rotation diet, but nothing seemed feasible for me. I was down to 118 pounds at five foot six which is below my minimum healthy weight by BMI, and a particular concern because I am a dedicated figure skater and I don't want to lose my hard-won muscles.I buy organic produce at the local farmers' market every Saturday. One farmer sells gluten-free cookies so over the weeks I have asked him why he sells them, how he figured out that he had celiac disease, etc. A few weeks ago he told me that he had used a new supposedly safe wood preservative on his goat house, which the goats had licked off the wood and been poisoned by. He drank the goat milk. Once the vet figured out what was going on, the farmer realized that he had been poisoned by the milk and set out to try to calm down his GI system. He ate only brown rice for three days, then added a new food each day to figure out what he could now eat.Thus for three days I ate only pumpkin and yogurt and was somewhat better. A friend told me about the lack of enzymes in pasteurized dairy products so I started taking Pancreatin which includes trypsin to break down the casein in the milk, and found that my GI system was much happier. Since then I have added one new food each day and found that ground flaxseed and onions make my system unhappy. I don't eat them any more and I'll avoid any other foods which cause problems. Now my GI system is gradually healing and letting me sleep more soundly. This process takes time, but I know that it is healing me.E-mail Margaret:[email protected]",,bed,diet,.doc,celiac disease,friend,food,goat,farmer,email,forest
96,"I am now in balance 99.9% of the time. I found this site several years ago when I googled 'Is it safe to take Imodium every day'. IBS Tales has been a Godsend, although reading about fellow sufferers makes me sad. I was an OR nurse for many  years - imagine how difficult that was! I had bloating, pain and diarrhea hell. I would take so much Imodium that I wouldn't go for a week! And that was almost a blessing.Anyway, once I knew that it was safe to take Imodium daily, I started a regimen. I also stopped taking my very small doses of amitriptyline, Bentyl and Celexa. I just wanted to get off the drugs and the (sad) insurance stigma here in the US of being on these meds. It was no fun going off the Celexa, which had been prescribed by my very good GI doc; withdrawal from an SSRI is a yucky feeling. But thank goodness I only had about a week of nausea and weirdness.I started taking one Imodium AM and PM, along with acidophilus AM and PM, and fiber in the afternoon. I also recently started on slippery elm bark, which I think has helped enough to eliminate my PM dose of Imodium. I feel great now, most of the time, thank God. I can travel, which I love to do, mostly without worry. I always keep plenty of Imodium at the ready, though. And an extra pair of underpants, sadly.I attribute my IBS to a bad bout of traveler's diarrhea when I was 22, encountered on a trip to Jamaica. The chronic symptoms began about a year later, when my daughter was nine months old. I still remember my first attack - I thought it was caused by rich food, having been out to dinner, or the flu. But the symptoms continued relentlessly over the years, and I was diagnosed four years later. The symptoms were somewhat controlled after the diagnosis by daily Metamucil, but that eventually didn't work. I only came to my current state of balance within the last two years, some 30-plus years later. This website has been so helpful in many ways, both emotionally and practically.

97,"I stumbled across this site months ago when I was having one of the worst episodes of IBS-D in my life. My doc had me on a prescription powder which was meant for high cholesterol, but the side effect to the drug was constipation. I had to take this disgusting orange powder three times a day with meals. Not only did it not work, but I was forced to only eat three meals a day, not the typical six smaller that I can tolerate (less gas, bloating etc).In desperation I googled IBS as well as gallbladder removal side effects - the episode this time resulted from extreme itching that I couldn't remedy or correct. I was (and still am) itchy all over my body...no rash, just insane itching...now I live on two pills of Reactine daily to control the itching.I discovered links between gallbladder removal and IBS, but I had (mild) IBS prior to the gallbladder removal, but the removal just made the IBS worse. Anyways, in my search as I said, I came across this site and read as much as I could. I read a bit from a woman who tried calcium caltrate, and her story was so similar to mine, I went out that day and bought the calcium caltrate. I quit the disgusting orange powder from the doc that same day.While it took an entire day to kick in, it worked. Then the next challenge was to get the right amount of calcium caltrate in my system. Turns out it is three pills a day. And my bowel movements are normal for the first time in as long as I can remember! I still have flares, but not as bad. Quitting smoking helped flare-ups, and I have quit drinking soda and am tweaking my meals as well. And guess what? Work is not torture anymore and vacations are not planned around bathrooms to the extent they used to be!I went to the doc and he tested my calcium levels for three months to confirm that I am not going too high in my calcium levels. I have to have a blood test once a year, but he was happy to hear that this is working for me. And since I am lactose intolerant (I am able to tolerate and even enjoy goat's milk and cheese etc) I hardly ever have cow's milk, cheese, etc and so he encouraged me to continue taking the calcium caltrate.Well, it has been about eight months on the calcium caltrate and like I said, other than the few flare-ups (these also correspond with my menses by the way) I am ecstatic with the results. Now I tell everyone I can think of...pharmacists...doctors...anyone in a position to help or recommend this treatment to IBS-D sufferers.

98,"In early October I had been out of work for six weeks, and I had promised my husband that I would return to work by the second week of October.  I ordered a copy ofSophie's Story, read it, and decided that if I was going to get better I was going to have to make that my full-time job because I had been waiting on the doctors and nothing was happening.So, I started searching and posing questions in the best possible way to try and find what I needed, and I stumbled across sauerkraut. I started out just eating sauerkraut, two to four tablespoons a day. My stomach began to feel better and so I did more research and decided to also start drinking sauerkraut juice.Unpasteurized sauerkraut is full of probiotics and other beneficial nutrients your body needs, but to receive the full benefit it has to be unpasteurized, which I actually have to order out of PA. Sauerkraut juice is a good juice to drink to help get things moving. I now eat anywhere from one to three tablespoons of sauerkraut a day and drink anywhere from half a cup to a cup of sauerkraut juice a day.I have been out of bed for nine weeks and back at work for seven weeks and I have not had to miss one single day of work. I have been sick for a while, and I certainly am  not back to 'normal' yet, but I am functional and regaining my confidence with each passing day.I am also doing a few other things as well, but I have no doubt at all that the sauerkraut and the sauerkraut juice played a huge role in helping me. I say this because when I was so sick the sauerkraut and the juice were the only things I was doing initially to battle my problem, because I had tried everything else.I also use 10 to 12 drops of fennel tincture three times a day and take a few supplements. I am trying to tweak things a little because I still suffer with some mild bloating and indigestion, but I have no doubt that in time that too will be a thing of the past. If this helps only one person, that is one less person who must live a nightmarish lifestyle.Thank you for writing you story down, I felt like I finally had a friend who got it, who understood that I wasn't faking and that I would rather die than live my life the way I was living. Just knowing that you are not alone in such a horrible situation makes all the difference in the world. Thank you again!

99,"Sophie, first I'd like to say THANK YOU for writing and publishing your story. While I suffer primarily from diarrhea, and all those other awful symptoms like urgency, gas, bloating, and foul flatulence, I relate to so much of your story. It was like reading a story about myself.I was diagnosed with IBS when I was 18. That was 26 years ago. I have always felt alone in this battle and that no-one understood. My dad just thinks I am a picky eater and my mom thought I was anorexic for much of my life. Embarrassment and social isolation have ruled my life. I have tried every prescription and over the counter remedy under the sun. I've been to several doctors and have gone through several tests.Several months ago I decided, based upon the advice of my chiropractor, to go gluten free. I felt better for a while but then about six months later I began having IBS attacks again and felt worse than ever. Long story short, I finally found a doctor who listened to me and acknowledged my pain and symptoms. She ordered various tests and I have been diagnosed with fructose malabsorption, which explains a lot, although further testing to rule out other problems has not been completed. I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled for next week to check for Crohn's, celiac disease etc, and then I will meet with the doctor for a final diagnosis.I guess I feel this is a happy tale because I've finally found a doctor who doesn't just look at me and say 'It is just your IBS. Eat more fiber.' I'm on the road to figuring things out I think. After testing, I'm going to try the fructose malabsorption elimination diet or FODMAP elimination diet and I am hopeful that I may begin to feel better. I think the mental anguish of IBS will never go away and I don't know if I can completely recover from the social phobia/anxiety that I've experienced for 26 years, but age is an advantage as I have somewhat overcome the embarrassment of talking about my problems.E-mail Stephanie:[email protected]",,tale,doctor,doctor,email,diet,celiac disease,exam,attack,anxiety,phobia
100,"I was recently diagnosed with IBS and I normally suffer most of my pain in the morning. After three hours of waking the pain finally subsides but I am left with bloating for the rest of the day. This makes my stomach look bigger than it really is and makes me not want to eat at all until dinner time. I usually indulge around dinner due to the fact that the bloating makes me not want to eat throughout the rest of the day, and that's why I always wake up in pain.I tried probiotics but they were so expensive; a 30-day supply was over $20 for even the generic brand! They worked slightly but I could not afford them and found myself stuck with nowhere to turn...until I told my friend about my issue and was surprised to hear that he too has IBS! He told me how well peppermint oil worked for him and two of his friends, so I went on tons of websites and read up on the reviews and facts.

101,"Although I am still living with IBS after 27 years, I am not putting this in the Sad Tale category as I am hopeful that I will find a treatment to cure my IBS. My IBS started when I was 21. I had anorexia nervosa for a few years. After I recovered and started eating again I started getting really bad stomach pains. I didn't understand at first what was happening.I remember the first time it happened. I was out with my friends shopping and I was standing in a shop. I suddenly got the most excruciating pains in my stomach and had to run for a toilet. I eventually started watching my diet. I stopped eating spicy foods, apples, fatty foods and basically anything I thought was triggering the stomach upsets. The biggest problem was the emotional fear, the fear of being caught short. I think this has been the worst part of IBS. The pain I could cope with, but the panic and fear of being caught short and embarrassed has been the worst.I am lucky, I can now eat almost anything I like without being stuck in a toilet at all hours of the day and night holding onto the walls from the pain. IBS is also a lonely illness. I have always felt embarrassed about discussing it and I have tried to manage it to a great extent on my own. Very few of the people who know me know I have IBS.My IBS is now mainly triggered by fear. Fear of traveling, fear of being stuck somewhere I can't get to a toilet. I am on a merry-go-round of fear. I have decided that by my 50th birthday I will be IBS-free. I am arranging to have hypnotherapy to help relieve the symptoms and hopefully I will be able to start my life anew, be able to do all the things I was once able to do without thinking about it.

102,"I'm a 20 year-old woman and I've been dealing with IBS symptoms since I was 15. It wasn't until college that I even began investigating my bowel issues and that lead to lots of awkward tests. There's a standing joke with my fiancee's family that I've had more colonoscopies than the old men in the house. At first I was mortified, like many diagnosed with the disorder.Throughout my entire testing period I prayed it wasn't IBS. I wanted a curable illness, damn it!When the GI doc finally told me it was IBS I just broke down. It seemed so impossible to deal with, especially as a college student. For a long long while I lead a miserably boring life. I lost 15 pounds because I virtually stopped eating and I never left my dorm. I even missed classes regularly because of my symptoms!But then one day I got angry. I mean really ridiculously angry. Why should I be embarrassed to have a bowel movement in a public restroom? Why should I not be able to go on road trips with my friends? And how dare some disease try to interfere with my future and hinder my career! I began researching everything about IBS. I experimented with trigger foods, I'm medicated for an anxiety disorder (that would play into my IBS terribly) and I embraced the God-sent pill, Imodium. As a matter of fact, I'm leaving for a road trip to Maine tomorrow night.

103,"I am a senior who has suffered with IBS-D for over 20 years. Before that I had constipation. I have never been normal. I remember when my children were young I would have night sessions where I hurt so bad it felt like knives cutting my gut. When done my legs were rubbery and I would barely make it back to bed. I was just glad it happened when the children were asleep.I was tested for ulcers, colitis and anything else they could think of. No results so then they think it's a mental issue. I was tested and discovered I am allergic to the protein in milk (sodium caseinate). So I elimated diary from my diet. However, I revolved into IBS-D.With losing my husband to brain cancer my life has become challenging. I have even tried a hypnotist. That didn't work. Finally I had some success with taking Xifaxan (which has become very expensive since getting FDA approval). I have followed that with a concoction I stumbled on.You core two fresh apples (leave the skin on), microwave for two minutes, add one tablespoon of cinnamon and put in one cup of ginger ale that has been allowed to go flat. Blend in a blender or juicer  and it makes it like apple sauce. Mix four spoonfuls of the mixture and add four spoonfuls of So vanilla coconut yogurt.I have had normal movements since eating this once a day. The only time I slipped was when I forgot to eat this. I wanted to share this miracle for me that maybe will help others. I believe what is helpful in this is the natural non-dairy probiotic effect in the yogurt, the pectin in the apple skin and the calming effect of the ginger in the gingerale.

104,"I was diagnosed with gallstones in 1968 and had the surgery. Shortly after I started having horrible diarrhea, which after a period of time created so much stress that for about 20 years I never ate out in public. After testing I was diagnosed with IBS. My husband was very understanding!In 1994 a work friend gave me some Lomotil tablets which helped greatly and my doctor prescribed it for me. He also prescribed cholestyramine and felt that would help control my bowel issues, but I didn't take that immediately. The Lomotil allowed me to go on vacations and eat out. Also, my daughter ran across an article about Habba disease which describes my issues.When I eat out, I also drink a Corona beer, which calms my nerves and appears to soothe my stomach. It seems to work great with my medications.In 2016, after a few ""issues"" or flu symptoms, I used Imodium, which stopped my diarrhea immediately. I started testing it, using it on a regular basis and it works fantastically well.I am using cholestyramine, only a quarter of a teaspoon at this time, with hopes of building up to the recommended dosage of four grams twice a day. This med cuts cholesterol, and as I stopped taking my statin drug, which I have issues with, I hope cholestyramine will keep my numbers down.I have been evaluating the Imodium and it appears to stop any bathroom issues. I am a widow and dating which could include a meal has been a nightmare to even think about. Could my new routine allow me to find my soul mate?My routine: I take my one Lomotil tablet every day routinely in the morning (it is prescribed three times a day), have my drink of cholestyramine mid-day and take one Imodium tablet before I eat.

105,"I’ve been living with IBS since I was diagnosed in 1998 at 18 years of age. However, I was perfectly healthy until I was 11. I had no known allergies, no medical conditions and every summer since I was two my mother would take me to Mexico City where she was born and raised along with six other siblings. I’m an only child, so for me this was fun yet difficult due to language barriers until I learned more Spanish each year.In the summer of 1991 my mother flew to Mexico City with me but returned home to the USA and left me for two months of summer break alone with my family. I knew most of her sisters, my aunts, who all had children close in age. So that summer was filled with a lot of new things, places and foods while I stayed with different aunts throughout the two months. I never drank water unless bottled.I was OK, yet I don’t recall much of that summer for whatever reason. I do remember being scared, especially when it was time to fly home on an airplane to LAX alone. I couldn’t wait to get back home and all was normal until the morning of my flight. I started having severe cramping, diarrhea and vomiting. My aunt assumed it was stomach flu or maybe something I ate. She drove me to the airport and I only recall needing the restroom a lot.I was scared by the time I had to board. I don’t recall much of the flight or anything about that summer. I do remember coming home and needing to use the restroom, being sick and crying because I didn’t feel OK. My mom talked to my aunts and we all assumed I caught flu or ate something bad.This continued for over two weeks and my mom took me to my doctor, who ordered so many tests as soon as he heard I had spent two months in Mexico City. I cried during some tests, I was nervous about school starting and like a light switch, my nightmare had begun.I was sent home often and then back to the doctors without answers. Tests came back OK, nothing abnormal found including no parasites. After three years of tests it was said I was lactose intolerant now and had IBS. I grew up drinking milk and nothing was a problem until then.Now I’ve learned coping skills and 23 years later I still have attacks.

106,"I suffer from nervous tummy IBS, and reading through the stories on this site, I am extremely relieved that I have the lightest symptoms of this 
awful condition. Almost 15 years ago I started to become aware of feeling extremely nervous when amongst company I didn't know and felt that I could not stay in a waiting room with strangers, or shuddered at the thought of sitting through meetings and courses where the surroundings were quiet. My stomach would bloat and then make the most horrendous gurgling sounds over and over again, which I used to blame on hunger - it was most embarrassing.The more I'd think about my stomach, the more nervous I became and I spiralled into a shy and introvert person.

I'd start work and constantly watch the clock, make excuses to visit another office or the factory - my work was starting to suffer, so I picked up the phone and made an appointment to see my doctor.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));I was a nervous wreck in the waiting room and fidgeted constantly.

I didn't want to take them too early in case they wore off, but soon realized that it wasn't the right thing to do.

108,"My stomach/cramping condition had been diagnosed as 'possibly' IBS - extreme pain/cramping/constipation, followed by the big 'D'. It was the worst pain I'd ever endured. Then, a couple years ago, I met a woman, my age (at the time, 34) who'd suffered the same, identical stomach pain as I had. She'd gone through all of the same tests (colonoscopy, endoscopy) and experimented with the same drugs her gastroenterologist had given her.By some chance, she figured out, over the course of several doctor visits, that she 'probably' had endometriosis. They performed a laparoscopy (the only way to diagnosis endometriosis) and her symptoms disappeared. Of course, endometriosis can return (ie: grow back...and as it does, can grow on your surrounding organs...gallbladder, ovaries and yes, your colon!), so this is not a lifetime cure for endometriosis....you may have to repeat the procedure every few years, or other treatments as prescribed by gynecologists.I also had a laparoscopy and guess what? No IBS symptoms for two years! I could live my life without having to think about when I was 'going to go' and revolve my work schedule around all of this pain! Of course, long before ever undergoing this procedure I had been talking to my gynecologist (and got a second opinion from another gynecologist) about all of my symptoms.I had been tracking my symptoms (type/kind/duration) on my day minder. It seemed to me that a lot of my symptoms/pain was just before and the week or so after my period. It's important to keep records of when the pain occurs. The only way a doctor can confirm endometriosis is via laparoscopy (they look at your internal organs by going through your belly-button via a small scope.Since my laparoscopy, over two years ago, my symptoms have slowly started to return...not in full force, certainly, but it is coming back. So, I will be undergoing another laparoscopy soon. Although it's not an easy procedure, it is one that works for my symptoms.I don't know if any of you have ever had this type of experience, but I just wanted to get the word out there, because I feel that I had been misdiagnosed and had been on IBS drugs for years before finding out what was going on with my system! In fact, my gynecologist had said that many women come into his office thinking that they have IBS, when in fact, they suffer from endometriosis. Don't know...just know what worked for me!

109,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_4']));For years I have suffered with really bad stomach problems. I just figured that it was stress. Working full time and going to college full time 
tends to do that to you. I would get constipated really bad and then experience an 'attack'. I hated it so much. It finally got to the point that I was spending so much time in the bathroom during class that I missed most of the lectures. And most of my exams were lecture-based.So I dropped out for awhile until I could figure out what was going on with my body. I ended up having a child, and after that my attacks got 
worse. I passed out a few times on the bowl. All I knew was that sometimes, the pain was worse than childbirth. My greatest fear was that my 
child would need me and I would be tied to the toilet and couldn't get to him. My son was good though and never complained about me dragging him into the restrooms with me for what must have seemed an eternity for him.Anyway, I tried all the laxatives and some would work, but the gas pains that came with them were unbearable. At that time, two of my best friends were diagnosed with IBS. They would listen to my tales of woe and would tell me, 'Go to the doctor, you have IBS'. So finally, I did. And I hated the tests. Don't we all!At this point, my mom got really sick, so I took care of her and my problems were put on the back burner. I got married about a year after this. My husband is pretty understanding. Plus, I like the fact that he can watch the kids while I'm in the restroom. Yes, I said kids. I had another child a couple of years back. My attacks got worse after that birth (which is why I don't want to have any more children). Pretty much every day was a bad day. Luckily, I can run off to the restrooms at work. The girls I work with are really understanding (one has IBS herself) and cover for me.My husband hated seeing me in pain. He finally dragged me back to the doctor for more tests. Now it's official: I have IBS. The doctor put me on Zoloft because I was suffering from depression because of my stomach problems. I noticed that after I started the Zoloft, my stomach got better. I asked my doctor and he told me that Zoloft can help with IBS in some cases.I've been on Zoloft for about four months. It does help with my problems. I'm not running to the restroom every single day, endless times a day, for what seems like hours. I don't get constipated like before. But I do eat and then have to go to the restroom about 5-10 minutes later. But like I tell my husband, I don't have to strain to have a bowel movement. There is no pain sometimes. And I've actually had some 'pain-free days'.The only times that I still do have a problem is when I'm on my period or ovulating. I have endometriosis. Endo and IBS do not go well together.

Sitting for my GCSE exams was a living nightmare, going on holiday to the Far East for the first time just as bad. I have had more stress counseling than I care to remember. The only good thing is that I have a very supportive doctor who diagnosed me at 16 so I have always been up-to-date with all the current treatments for the disorder.But I don't let it rule my life. I am sat here today writing this feeling so bloated I feel sick; I have not been to the toilet for six days now. But 
I am still at work and I will still be going out with my friends tonight.The reason for this current bout of IBS is that I am in the first stages of moving house, so I have already accepted that I am going to be ill with IBS for the next few months until I have moved into my new house. They do say this is one of the most stressful times of your life!My boyfriend asked me to marry him two months ago and we have set a date for March next year.

I don't know what I can do to stop me being bloated, constipated and generally in agony for my big day.I love organizing but I know I am going to get stressed about things, and of course as soon as I start getting excited about it I know I will be ill. This will make the day hell and the honeymoon not much better. It is a vicious circle, though as a long-time sufferer I am aware of situations that are going to make me more susceptible to being ill, but the more you think about how to prevent it the more you get wound up and you just end up getting it worse for longer.I have spoken to my doctor and we have agreed I am going to take Valium for the week before the wedding. This is the only way I can think of to chill me out enough to not get ill. But it is sad that sufferers all around the world are faced with these options to get through their lives.But I will not let this disease rule me.

112,"I'm not sure when I started with IBS, but was I diagnosed by my gynecologist doctor last year. To cut a long story short, after an operation I had the 
contraceptive mirena coil inserted. At the six week check-up I told them that I felt worse than I had before the operation. Among the many symptoms I was feeling I was constantly needing the toilet and had extremely severe tummy cramps and bloating, and switched from diarrhea to constipation.Each day it was a struggle getting out of bed to go to work. Everything I ate seemed to disagree with me. I took Fybogel twice a day, which ended up making the constipation worse, and I took Buscopan for the tummy pain (which did help a lot). I then went to a food intolerance nurse, and although it did help it did not make the symptoms go away.I went on the net and did some searching and found loads of information on the side effects of the mirena coil, and some cases where it either 
started people off with IBS or made IBS symptoms worse. I got the coil taken out a couple of months ago, and almost all the symptoms have gone. I no longer have to rush to the toilet or make sure I'm near somewhere where there is a loo handy, and I haven't had any tummy cramps since. I also feel a lot happier and energetic. So if there is anyone with IBS who is on the mirena coil then it might be worth their while to have a wee look on some of the newsgroups.",,stomach,operation,toilet,cramp,constipation,side effect,bed,couple,people,load
113,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));This is a happy tale, since I have finally licked IBS. Am I cured? No...but I am having normal bowel movements for the first time as an adult, 
and I am virtually symptom-free in every other way. I'm taking the time to write this because I am so grateful to the many anonymous people whose stories I read on the web - stories which gave me a piece here, a piece there, and contributed to me finding a happy ending to this miserable episode of my life. I only hope my story will help others in the same way.I have had this condition for my whole adult life, and I am now over 50 years old. My symptoms were classic ones. Diarrhea-prone, I got along for many years with daily minor discomfort, thinking that's just the way it was. I never had a normal bowel movement, but as far as I knew mine were 'normal', and the fact that I had to rush to the bathroom three times in a row every morning, I just accepted. Once every month or so - probably after eating a particularly rich meal - I would have blistering abdominal pain in the middle of the night for several hours. But this would go away, and again I just accepted that this was normal.Things were basically tolerable - that is until I suddenly went 'C'. It began in the late fall of 2004 and went on for an entire year non-stop. I 
had always thought diarrhea was terrible, but boy, did I ever start to really wish for it all back after I began to experience a life of constant 
constipation.It was not just not being able to go that was so awful, it was all of the other symptoms that came along for the ride, such as that particularly 
miserable unfinished feeling, frequent intestinal spasms and, of course, the terrific, very anti-social gas that went on, day and night. Occasionally, I 
gave myself an enema and that was the only thing which gave me some relief.I had been to doctors many times over the years and knew that, for the most part, Western medicine could not help me. I had tried homeopathy and acupuncture, to no avail. Now in desperation I spent lots of time on the internet reading pages like these and going onto blogs and chat rooms for hours.After a full seven months of chronic constipation you start to wonder, ghoulishly, what the inside of you must look like. Soon I began to know 'in my gut' that what I needed, desperately, was colon cleansing, but I was unable to find anyone to do this, professionally, whom I felt I could trust. So, one summer's day I went into the bathroom and, with the aid of an old-fashioned water bottle equipped with enema attachment, proceeded to administer colonic irrigation to myself.Within a 48-hour period I did 15 enemas, using plain warm water or water mixed with a weak mixture of lemon juice, probiotics and alfalfa. I amazed myself that it took 15 times to get myself clean. I did about seven enemas at the first session. Each took about 15 minutes. By rolling onto my back and getting my pelvis up in the air many times (think bicycle exercise) I was able to also clean the small intestine (in my body that is the area that traps the material the most). The next day, I took a deep breath, went right back in there and repeated this process. I kept it up until the liquid coming out of me was running almost clear.Now, I realize that this all may sound quite horrifying, or at the very best, gross and disgusting. Yes it was disgusting to have to go through this, and I can surely say that it was not a pleasant experience...but it was wonderfully empowering to know that I could do this and get myself truly cleaned out. The light, healthy feeling I had, after getting all that toxic material out of me, was phenomenal...and the emotional relief was fantastic.After the self-administered colon cleansing , I was able to start from scratch with a new diet and, in a few months time, begin to make myself 
really well. With the help of a good nutritionist, I learned about eating a diet according to 'the new pyramid'. Yes, 11 servings of grain a day (one 
serving is five grams).I eat high fiber, so generally eschew white bread and white rice altogether. Basically, I eat mostly whole wheat flour breads, whole wheat 
pasta, brown rice, barley and cornmeal dishes (corn bread and polenta).I try to stay with seven to nine servings of fat a day. I have mostly given up cheese and never eat ice cream. I try to stay with five meals a day 
that are smaller, rather than the three big meals a day Americans are so used to. I eat less meat and lots of fruit and vegetables. I eat low dairy. 
Also, contrary to the standard advice, in my case I have found that I can indeed drink a moderate amount of caffeine and alcohol each day with no problem.I studied up on soluble versus insoluble fiber, using insoluble fiber for C and soluble fiber for D. Resistant starch is another crucial piece to the diet. Cold pasta, cold rice, cold potatoes and beans (of any temperature) all classify as resistant starch. I include one or more of these food groups in my diet every day.I take a heaping tablespoon of golden flaxseed meal per day, since it helps the movement of material out of you. Basically I am having fat, 
healthy stools every day...if I do run into a problem over a three to five-day period, then I help myself along by taking two stool softeners. That usually gets me going right away, and there are no side effects. Taking magnesium daily is also helpful.Over the last year I have completely changed the way I eat and I have learned to love the food that loves me. Do I have to pay attention to this every day? You're darn right. But it is managed now, and I am running it, it is not running me. It feels so glorious to have a healthy intestinal system.",,tale,diet,meal,rice,rice,bread,white,fat,pasta,starch
114,"I wrote my story a few months ago, talking about my IBS-C and how awful it had been. I had even lost a considerable amount of weight with it and was constantly using laxatives and suppositories and anything else they could throw my way.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Following on from this my doctor prescribed me a brand of anti-depressants that he had heard had been successful with other patients. They were a member of the Prozac family. However, the outcome of taking this medication was that I could barely get out of bed because it killed my enthusiasm for life. The bubbly girl that I usually am despite often crying because of the pain of constipation and bloating was completely sapped of all life.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I was also awaiting an appointment with a hospital in London for Biofeedback and a transit study. However, the appointment was for late October which seemed like a lifetime away. I instead went to my local GP who is a very understanding man (I finally found one who is determined to help not brush me aside). Anyway he was concerned about my weight loss and decided to write to the hospital where I would be going for biofeedback training and the transit study.This letter worked. I was put on the waiting list and I received a call from the hospital to tell me that they had an appointment early in 
September. I was required not to use laxatives or anything of the kind for six days before the transit study. I was about fit to burst because despite going to the toilet in bits I was not able to clear everything. Or at least that is what I thought.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));The study was very positive because it showed that my bowel was emptying like it should be with the recommended amount, but the problem was that I had to go a lot to clear it out whereas other people would be able to do this in one go...and therefore I was having the problem with bloating and feeling constipated all the time!Now it suddenly dawned on me that before IBS I never really paid much attention to the number of times I went to the toilet, and therefore it was only when I originally got IBS-D that this normal bodily function became such an important part of my life. For that I was treated with 
anti-depressants and when I came off them I was then faced with the constipation because again my body was doing something different.Anyway the specialist nurse was so nice - she spoke to me about my eating habits, my exercise habits and also what treatments I had had in the past. It was very comprehensive, probably the most comprehensive consultation I have ever had. Then she told me about Biofeedback training. It is a process of retraining the muscles that we use to go to the toilet to do their job properly again.Part of the way that she investigated to see how the muscles are working was to get me to lie down, and she inserted a balloon into my rectum. Once it was inflated she asked me to try to push it out. I was unable to do this and she stopped me and told me that I had fallen into bad habits due to all my problems with the IBS.She made me put my hands on my waist and feel the muscles that I am supposed to use for going to the toilet. They are called the brace muscles and in order to use them properly we have to expand our waist and push from our waist! Now it might seem stupid that I wouldn't know this, but the nurse explained to me that because we learn to use these muscles instinctively as babies, when they don't work properly we are not aware of what muscles do what because we have never had to be aware of them before.Following this test the nurse gave me some exercises that I have to do every day - sitting on the toilet 30 minutes after breakfast for 10 minutes and training the muscles using this pushing technique. It doesn't necessarily mean that you go to the toilet but it is about getting the bowel 
into a routine of emptying.She told me that it will take anything up to six months to really get to see any positive changes, but in that time I will see her a further three 
times. On top of that she told me that she does not want me to use laxatives at all. If anything I am only allowed to use suppositories if it is an 
emergency.It has been about three weeks since my appointment and I have seen some serious improvement already. I have even been away on holiday and I had eight days pain-free out of the total 10 which is a miracle for me. My body has already started to get into a routine of going first thing in the morning...and although it is not perfect it is a start which I am very positive about.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));Also while I was on holiday I was able to completely relax and take time for myself so that helped my body as well. I was less afraid of food to eat and subsequently I was able to put on half a stone. It is not all light at the end of the tunnel because I still swell and get a lot of gas and 
bloating, but I am pretty sure that it is due to some foods that I am eating. Therefore I am going back to the dietician to continue the elimination diet.One piece of news is the importance of testing intolerance to tap water. Originally when I went to see the dietician she told me to stop drinking anything but bottled water, and this included not drinking tea unless it was with bottled water and also not using tap water in cooking. I thought 'What?' Anyway I went along with it thinking this has got to be crazy, but it was not nonsense.In order to test the water I was required to drink water directly from the tap in large amounts over two days, but after 30 minutes of drinking the water I was in agony. This even included filtered water. I have now cut out tap water in everything. I don't drink tea at work and I bring water with me from home. Also I never use tap water in cooking, and I never have ice cubes in my drinks when I am out.I tested this theory when I was away on holiday. After two days of drinking drinks with ice cubes I suffered bloating, gas and pain. After I 
cut out the ice cubes this went away! Now I am not sure why the tap water does this, but the only conclusion that I can come to is that it might be trace chemicals in the water upsetting the balance. I spoke to my dietician and she said that one other girl she treated found tap water to be one of the triggers - therefore it might be rare but it does happen.I am determined to find out what the other triggers are. I think dairy (in particular cheese) is an irritant and also whole meal breads but I am yet to fully experiment. I have read two books recommended to me by people who read my original story on IBS Tales and e-mailed me, called Eating for IBS and The First Year - IBS. These books offer very good advice on diet and alternative therapies.I am also thinking of doing acupuncture. I have discovered that it can now be done on the NHS. I can make one saving on this, because I have made huge investments into alternative therapies.I am now more positive about everything. Yes I still am not right and I might never be, but with some investment and investigation and the support of my family and friends I am almost back to the totally bubbly girl that I was before I got IBS five years ago. IBS has cheated me of five years of my 20s and I want to make sure that I do not lose the next five to IBS.I would also like to say a massive thank you to you for setting up IBS Tales because it has been a great lifeline for me. It has meant that people have shared their experiences with me and written to me from many different parts of the world offering advice, and it has been fantastic.As someone wrote to me: 'Please all those out there with IBS don't give up - never give up!' Find a good doctor and it doesn't matter if you have to go every week for months, it can pay off. Don't settle for being fobbed off by doctors either, especially in hospitals - if you think you are being treated badly by a doctor complain and see someone else, and if you have to go to a different hospital do it. I did this and it is the reason that I was given the option to have biofeedback training.They are paid to help us who are sick and they have no right to treat us badly, and we have no reason to accept it either. It took me five years but I eventually found an understanding GP and subsequently found a good gastroenterologist through him as well. This story is a far cry from the original one that I wrote as desperate 25 year-old with IBS-C, but I wanted to share it with you and maybe I can help some others out there with this horrid affliction.Update on Priscilla...In the last two months my symptoms have been really up and down. I am still doing the exercises that they told me to do at therapy, but I have also found some things that have really helped, and they were all available at Holland and Barrett. I have tried them as a trial for a week, and after one week my symptoms turned around. I have now gone 12 days with no symptoms and no constipation. This is the longest stint now within the six years I have ever had.Part of me is terrified that it will end, but I am just hoping that it doesn't. I am counting every day and that sounds weird, but like you will 
know I having suffered so long - you see every day as a triumph, and although my friends think that I am crazy they respect my constant count-up of days and actually laugh when I look so excited about it.My boyfriend says that I have changed emotionally and in my attitude to everything - I can completely understand where he is coming from because I can be very distracted and unhappy when the IBS is bad. Now I am singing in the mornings and smiling loads at work even when work gets hectic. It is amazing that it can have such an effect on your mood but it does.Anyway, today has been my twelfth day with no symptoms, and I mean no bloating, no pain, no gas, and no constipation, and I am doing it without any medical drugs. My regime is all herbal and natural. First thing in the morning I take two strawberry chewable acidophilus tablets before I eat breakfast (they are from Holland and Barrett). Along with that I take one peppermint capsule - they are from Boots because they do not repeat as much as others I have tried. I also take a multivitamin from Holland and Barrett. They are all free of any additives, and because I am on the elimination diet at the same time they are free from possible triggers such as lactose etc.Then at night I take one Aloe Vera Colon Cleanse high strength tablet. It took seven days for all this stuff to kick in, and for that week I continued to use suppositories, but after the seventh day I had a breakthrough. I now suffer no constipation and I have no real symptoms of IBS, even in the run up to my period. I continue to do the exercises that I was told to do by the therapist at the hospital where I do my biofeedback training. I have also spoken to her and showed her what I take and she saw no problem with any of it because it is all natural.Further to this I am also on the elimination diet to try and determine the foods that might trigger an attack. This has been a positive step for me also. I know that it might seem a little strange because I know everyone tries the herbal supplements, but I stumbled over these because I thought what harm could it do and I am having luck with it. I have also found that since I have been on the diet and also on the tablets even my acne has cleared up and I have been struggling with it for months. My dietician thinks that it could be a food allergy that has contributed to some of my problems and therefore the elimination diet is the best way to discover what it could be.I am counting every day as a positive step and I just wanted to share my little bit of success with you as your website has been such a good help to me when I have been very ill.

115,"I've chosen to put my story in the happy tales section even though I am far from happy. However, I have recently been taking magnesium supplements and have found that it has helped a bit. I suffer from constipation-dominated IBS with extreme bloating, pain and wind. I've been 
taking magnesium for about three weeks now and I have found that it is a little easier to go in the mornings.Before, I had to drink lots of warm water and slowly eat cereal with warm soya milk, then sit on the toilet for 45 minutes straining. Now I find that when I try going in the morning it's a teeny weeny bit easier. I go without straining at first but it stops suddenly mid-bowel movement, then I return to feeling awfully constipated. But at least I manage to get some of the waste out which helps towards me feeling less (excuse the pun) crap through the day.I'm going to try 'cleaning' up my diet too as I found that cutting out wheat, dairy, and processed or fried foods helped me a little before.

I read somewhere that milk can have a detrimental effect on some people's GI systems, so I cut milk out of my diet. After a day I was already feeling better, and three weeks later, I'm still regular. No more hard and painful stools, no more straining, no more worry.I have also heard that gluten can be very detrimental to you if you have celiac disease. So if this dairy-free doesn't work for me, that is next on my list. I feel like a new person already.

117,"I have suffered from IBS with constipation for three years now. I had no bowel problems until just after I graduated high school. Growing up, I never really had any trouble unless I was staying at a friend's house or on vacation somewhere. I usually wouldn't have a bowel movement for the first few days, but I would eventually and I never had any pain - I just didn't go for a while.This all changed out of nowhere. I don't think there was anything that made my IBS start. Although, my periods did become more painful around the same time. One day I just realized I hadn't gone to the bathroom in five days! I usually would go every day or every other day. For about the first two weeks I just took some Correctol and I was OK for a few days, and then I was constipated again.I went to the family doctor and she just told me to take stool softeners, but they didn't help much at all. I was really miserable at this point. I was going to start college in about a month and I couldn't even enjoy my summer.I was able to get an appointment with the gastroenterologist that my mom sees (she has Crohn's disease). He almost immediately diagnosed me with IBS after a few questions and gave me Zelnorm to take. I did have to schedule a sigmoidoscopy to rule out Crohn's disease since my mom has it. It wasn't pleasant, but everything looked normal.Well, the Zelnorm worked great from the start. I felt pretty normal for about eight months with occasional bloating and gas, but noting too bad. I was even able to cut back on the Zelnorm to once every other day.But the next summer it started to get bad again, so I was taking the Zelnorm every day. About this time I also started to date my current boyfriend. He lived about an hour away from me, so I would spend weekends at his house. The weekends were terrible for my stomach. I was almost never able to have a bowel movement when I was there and the pain and cramps were horrible. This went on for about a year and I eventually started taking laxatives every weekend, just so I wasn't in pain the whole time I saw my boyfriend.Last summer, the Zelnorm stopped helping me. I called my doctor and he told me to take it twice a day. This helped about 25% of the time. But every time I ate something I would have cramps unless I went to the bathroom after I ate. I had to get another appointment because I was feeling worse than ever! He prescribed Amitiza to be taken once a day, along with Zelnorm once a day. He also suggested probiotics.The Amitiza and Zelnorm actually worked, but they would sometimes give me diarrhea so I didn't take them if I was eating out somewhere. The probiotics did make me feel less bloated, but I only took them for a month because they were pretty expensive.I graduated community college last fall and moved in with my boyfriend. Since I'm not in school anymore, my mom's health insurance no longer covers me. This is a big problem because my two prescriptions would cost about $200 a month after the discount (my boyfriend's mom works at the pharmacy so we get her discount of 20% off). My boyfriend suggested I try to stop taking them and see what happens, but I was so scared I would be in pain and never be able to poop! Instead, we bought some stool softeners which don't cost much, and they actually worked this time!I've been taking the stool softeners for about six months and I'm doing pretty good. I still have some bad days, but I've only had to resort to taking a laxative once in six months, so that's pretty good! I also try to eat a lot of fiber and I avoid a lot of dairy because I know that makes the cramping worse. My stomach still feels bloated most days and I have a lot of gas, but overall I'm doing the best ever since my IBS first started. I still feel pretty limited in what I can do. For example, if I wanted to travel I would be very nervous that I would be in pain the whole time and not be able to have a bowel movement. I still worry that my IBS will get bad again, but for now I'm enjoying feeling good.E-mail Jennifer:[email protected]",,pain,boyfriend,mother,Summer,Crohn's disease,health insurance,discount,cramp,stomach,gas
118,"I was diagnosed with IBS about 11 years ago. I had been having horrible pains in my lower stomach, and when a diagnosis of endometriosis, and surgery for, it didn't alleviate the pain I was sent to a gastro specialist who told me that I had IBS. At the time, I thought it was a catch-all; a 'made-up' illness.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));For the next eight years I worked out heavily and ate a low-fat diet, and my symptoms disappeared. Three years ago I took a break from my heavy workouts and let my diet slip. I started to bloat and have horrible constipation, pain and tenderness. I felt too exhausted and miserable to work out at all, yet alone the several hours a day I'd worked out before. Every few weeks, I'd hit the other extreme and have horribly loose stools.After some research, I realized that I was exhibiting classic IBS symptoms and that it was a 'real' illness. I bought Digestive Advantage at the supermarket, and it worked miracles. The bloating left. I have bowel movements every day.

All my problems stem from constipation, ie: the bloating and spasms go away if the constipation is relieved, and consequently I have been looking for remedies to tackle just that, up until now not entirely successfully.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));So-called 'Dr Schüssler salts', which are similar to homeopathic remedies, help, and homeopathy (silicea). These often help me, but admittedly they never restored my once perfect bowel movements. Something that helps me go as well, especially in the morning, is warm tea and lots of it (even without milk)I've found that milk relaxes my muscles when I'm troubled by constipation. Although if I drink it in the afternoon or evening it makes my symptoms much worse, as I get the urge to go to the loo but my colon simply won't co-operate. My diet is more than ideal, and that actually worsens my symptoms.Insoluble fiber in large quantities, especially in the evening, makes me want to go, but I can't. It's a nightmare with cauliflower or bran, but actually better with white bread (which I know is not very healthy). The way things used to be, I lived by the rules of food-combining, ie: not eating protein and carbs simultaneously, but something like that again has me desperately straining over a toilet bowl. Outcome: pellets. At the best.What helps though is soluble fiber. Even things like chocolate or sweets cause me no problems, but I don't actually like them and I know they aren't exactly healthy, that's why I consciously came off them a while ago and never again acquired the taste for them. Danone Activia has helped me once or twice, and coffee does as well. There are special yoga poses you can find online, and the ones recommended for constipation do work for me to a certain extent.Ironically enough, what has helped me enormously is exam stress, or more like anxiety before an exam. No more lazy bowels then, curiously enough. Of course this can't last forever, but I just thought I'd jot it down as it's nothing short of intriguing. Constipation apart, for the symptoms which go with it, I've found something excellent for bloating and flatulence, which is Protexin Balance.The types of medication I've been on are too many to count, but the two I could say that actually worked are Meteospasmyl and Buscopan. I must admit though that my body got used to them after a couple of weeks, so I stopped taking them. I did try Digestrol, which is incredibly expensive and did not help me, if anything it made my symptoms worse.I sympathize with all of you. The number of times I've wished I had any other illness but this. But you're not the one that decides, your digestive tract does, and anyway we all know one can't think like that. I do get down sometimes and the future seems bleak. Occasionally I have wished that I'd have diarrhea instead of constipation.

120,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I am 25 years old and I have been suffering from IBS for the last three years (diagnosed a year and a half ago). It began with irrational diarrhea and now tends to consist of waves from excruciating pain from bloating and constipation, to what feels like a mild stomach upset. I have gone for a whole month at a time without too much bother, only to be hit by an onslaught of symptoms without an apparent lifestyle change that I can pin-point.I have tried several remedies, both self-prescribed and those recommended by my very supportive GP. These include soluble fiber, peppermint (tea and capsules), laxatives of every variety under the sun, Wind-eze and every other brand of the same product, diets consisting of vegetable soups and masses of All-bran, etc!My doctor was shocked when I made a list of the amount of laxatives/over-the-counter wind-relieving products I used on a daily basis and 
made me promise never to touch any of them again...A difficult task indeed as I had become reliant on many of the pills I'd been taking on and off for the previous couple of years! I have been prescribed mebeverine tablets to take as and when I need to relieve the pain from bloating. These worked at first but after six months I am finding them less successful.I took up smoking in a moment of desperation when hit by possibly my worst case of constipation (it had been a long, long time!). A daily diet of strong coffee, strong cigarettes and lots of bran did begin to do the trick, and as a staunch anti-smoker I am sad to say that smoking was quite possibly one of the best remedies I have tried. However, after five months I gave that up too, and what followed was two months of embarrassing wind at work, terrible cramps from my constipation and sudden inexplicable bouts of diarrhea when my body appeared to suddenly give way.I have said that this is a happy tale because the most success I have had recently has been from what feels like an excessive consumption of...water! I wake up, drink about three liters of the stuff and continue in the same vain as the day continues. Together with the yoga poses taught to me earlier in this year when I was in India (the yogi masters there ask you several medical questions before they decide which poses you should practise) and replacing my six cups of builder's tea at work with peppermint tea, I feel much better!I cannot tell you if I have found a remedy that works for me which does not rely on the excessive consumption of chemicals, or if my body has just fallen into one of those spells where my IBS doesn't seem to be as severe as normal, but I can tell you I feel so relieved right now! They say that IBS is exacerbated by stress and worry. It is therefore a terrible cycle - I was constantly asked by my doctor 'Are you stressed?' to which I would reply 'I wouldn't be if only I could go to the toilet normally and not have this pain!' No other part of my life is stressful!The worry that comes with having taken excessive amounts of pills for the last few years has been (I hope not temporarily) relieved by finding natural remedies (that work!) for my problem. Perhaps it is merely this relief which has eased my symptoms - I don't know if I will ever really know, but for the moment I feel better than I have in a long time!",,remedy,pain,constipation,pill,tea,doctor,doctor,bran,consumption,diet

123,"eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I was diagnosed with irritable bowel about a year ago but I suffered the symptoms for much longer. At first I didn't believe the diagnosis, as each time I went into a doctor's office describing my symptoms I received no tests yet they were quite happy to tell me I had IBS. The doctors gave me no hope, pointing out it was related to stress, with several adamantly telling me that my diet would not contribute to my symptoms.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I would go from suffering constipation and not passing anything for up to a week, sometimes longer, to finally when the gates opened suffering from diarrhea. Worst of all was the gas, flatulence and belching. The middle of the night and mornings were the worst, until I would regularly set my alarm for 5am so I could try to belch and fart out all of my gas, which would abate the cramps, before I went to work.Later I decided to get fit and slim down as I had gained weight from working full time. I started going to the gym every day. I stopped eating fast food. I limited how much meat I ate. I cut out of my diet completely all oily and fried food and only cooked using extra virgin olive oil, if any oil was used. I cut out almost all dairy as it carries a lot of calories, and I started taking supplements. I also stopped drinking soft drinks and fruit juice as these contributed to a lot of my daily calorie intake.Miraculously the symptoms of my IBS disappeared! Through trial and error with my diet I have been able to pinpoint my symptoms down to a few things...Animal fats and large quantities of animal meat: animal fats will certainly make me feel a bit cramped and bloated but even large amounts of meat will set me off. I just don't eat steaks that much anymore, horrible when living in an Australian family where the traditional meal is a steak with mash potatoes. What I mean by not much is that I would be lucky to eat a steak once every two months. If I was to eat meat often it'd be in a stir fry with lots of veggies, lean and in small amounts.Dairy is still a part of my diet in small, small amounts but again it contains animal fats, especially cheese, and makes me generally suffer gas and cramps. Unlike most sufferers bread doesn't set me off so I find that if I get that oily heavy feeling in my stomach eating some bread to soak it up seems to lessen my feelings of nausea.Oils for some reason also affect my stomach. I can't really describe it except for the feeling of heaviness in the stomach. I just know that my bowels respond to anything oily, especially if the oils are separated from the food. If I was to eat something with oil dripping off of it I would have a stronger reaction than if the oils were mixed into the food such as in a cake.Soft drinks can also set it off. I don't know if it is the sugar (though I still eat sweets with no problems), or if it is because it is carbonated. All I know is if I have two glasses my tummy will make me pay with a vengeance.Recently I had to add another item to the list, which I had a horrible reaction to: cabbage. I had a salad which I made with mainly cabbage and in the morning had quite a violent reaction to it. The first I have had in quite a long time since I have been on my low-calorie diet.To this date I have had no problem with wheat items, though I do like to eat 'brown' carbohydrates or low GI equivalents. So I eat basmati rice instead of jasmine rice, brown/whole grain bread instead of white, and pasta is relatively low GI. Though rice does have a lot of carbohydrates in it.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I guess I'll plan out what I eat for my meals now so perhaps if you are suffering the same symptoms you can try it out. These are very low-calorie options. I tend to keep an eye on my calorie count as although these healthy options stopped my IBS I don't want to starve either. I tend to jack up the calorie count to healthy levels by snacking on a lot of fruit during the day. Bananas are really good as they are about 100 calories each and tend to feel 'light' on the tummy.I tend to categorize everything into 'light' and 'heavy'. 'Heavy' foods I try to eat in moderation and/or cut out of my diet as they tend to set off my IBS. Generally 'heavy' foods give you the feeling you have after eating McDonald's, where it was nice going in but afterwards you get the horrible feeling, then suddenly you are in the bathroom retching, and the cramps, bloating and IBS have struck again.Breakfast: fruit. This will generally be several servings of fruit, a banana, an apple and a pear. Generally I like breakfast to be light and I will stagger it out over a period of a few hours as most of my symptoms are in the morning. Generally I just like to limit what is in the tummy as I find that if there is too much food in there it will kick up my IBS anyway. Also if it has flared up I don't want to put too much ammunition into my stomach in case I do feel the compulsion to vomit.Lunch: homemade pumpkin soup or a large salad or both. I tend to make the pumpkin soup with very little vegetable stock and no milk. I want it to be thick rather than creamy and watery because it is more filling that way and I don't want to starve. I tend to boil the pumpkin in just enough water to cover it. Pour out just a touch of the water, mash it, blend it. Add a tiny touch of stock and there you go. To pack in some flavor I will cook chickpeas on the side and add them into the blend and then put in some Moroccan spices. This makes it taste like a wonderful curry and I'll have that with two slices of bread. I don't tend to pack too much soup as again if I eat until I am bursting rather than satisfied it sets off the IBS.Snack: more fruit. Or if you go to an Asian grocer they sell a product called 'Pocky', read the back labels but their chocolate-covered sticks are generally around 100 calories. This is definitely good if you like chocolate but find the milk fats in the chocolate bars tend to set off your IBS. I find the worse thing for encouraging my symptoms is getting a chocolate craving. I think to myself 'Well I haven't had symptoms in a while, I want my comfort food, and I have been eating well and a little won't hurt'. Then I spend the night in the bathroom suffering cold chills, hugging the toilet.Dinner: simple stir fry with a lot of vegetables. I find Asian greens are quite nice on my stomach as well as cucumber. If we're having steak then I have about enough meat to fit the palm of my hand, this is discounting fingers! I usually chop it up and get rid of all visible fat. I then eat it with a lot of helpings of veggies or salad. I find if I eat meat in one big lump it feels worse on the tummy instead of eating it in small slices broken up by mouthfuls of veggies.I know it seems a bit much to outline what I eat but I find if I deviate from this too much my IBS flares up and truthfully I am tired of taking sick days from work because I can't seem to pry myself away from the toilet.I can't stress enough that the best way to minimize my reactions to eating was to slow down the eating process. I make my meals last for as long as possible, that way some food has already passed through the stomach by the time I have finished eating. Generally I like to think if something is going to set off my tummy it is better that it is sliding through your stomach and bowels in small amounts rather than in one big lump where your body is just going to react and spasm.Finally I found that if I really felt terrible, like I needed to puke, that eating something acidic would help. I have been told that when your stomach is irritated the gallbladder releases bile into the stomach. The bile is what makes you feel terrible. I would usually drink some lemon juice in water or even sip some vinegar. It doesn't sound that appetizing but something highly acidic can break down some of the bile that your body is releasing.I hope this helps other people because I found the doctors were no help whatsoever. I have to admit that I haven't completely gotten rid of my symptoms as I still have constipation, but now I can resume a normal life, not have to plan where the bathroom is, or organize time before work where I could lock myself in a bathroom because I was going through periods of continually being sick. I don't have to carry a toothbrush with me anymore in case something sets off my stomach and I get physically ill.Most of all I hated the uncertainty where I would feel terrible before work and call in sick only to recover during the day. Other times I would feel terrible before work and go in anyway, only to spend large amounts of time walking back and forth to the toilet feeling queasy, not sure if I was going to have diarrhea, puke or possibly both.Doctors are good and helpful don't get me wrong, but at the same time nutrition is not a course that is emphasized in the medical profession. I find that a lot of doctors are happy to give you pills but aren't happy to discuss the effects of diet on the symptoms of IBS. Perhaps even the process of making yourself feel like you are in control by limiting your diet helps alleviate the stress that causes IBS. Either way if you don't feel like you are getting the right answers from your doctors do some additional research or ask for a second opinion. Try to find a medical professional who has actually done some in-depth study into IBS.E-mail Jessica:[email protected]",,stomach,food,diet,toilet,calorie,meat,stomach,doctor,doctor,oil

I have tried keeping a journal in order to identify the possible triggers, to no avail. The bloating and excruciating pain have forced me to stay home from work or leave work early. Lately, the bloating was so severe, my regular clothes would not fit and I went almost instantly from a fit size eight to looking five months pregnant! Even after the attack, the pain lingered for about three more days.I have been taking Digestive Advantage since my last bout of IBS and I still cannot believe it! The symptoms are gone!

In addition to my daily Digestive Advantage capsule, I take L-Glutamine (500 mg) every morning along with one cup of water with the juice of half a lemon plus another glass of water. I take all of these first thing in the morning.Before Digestive Advantage I would simply ride the IBS storm with sleep, a heating pad, and wonton soup. Go figure! I was terrified of eating after each attack. IBS was always the price to pay after over-indulging.

It could have been my gallbladder as a few years ago it was taken out and I was told it was so huge and full of cholesterol stones.I never watched what I ate, but it never seemed to matter. If you think about it, when you're eating well you still get it, or when you're upset sometimes you don't get it...I do think it has a mind of its own. I was told to take some psyllium, and I was told it would help both diarrhea and constipation, but it didn't. It swelled up in me and totally blocked me so bad I nearly had to go in to get unplugged. Never did that again.I do realize though looking back (I'm now 57 years old with five kids) I learned to live with it. When I was busy I hardly noticed it as I was too concerned with my kids. Distraction is a great tool. I did have to have a bathroom or know where the bathrooms were everywhere I went. I do ask about that today, when someone says let's go for a walk in the forest I go 'Let's take some toilet paper'.One time I didn't go to the bathroom for a while and I knew it was the constipation. I was hurting so bad I went in and an x-ray was done. The doctor says 'Oh no, you're blocked, impacted'. So he immediately gave me some Miralax or something like that. I went home and took some and it did clear me out, and I was told to take it daily, but after three days I had constant diarrhea.E-mail Vickie:[email protected]",,toilet,constipation,pain,mother,email,home,kid,school,constant,doctor
130,"I've suffered from constipation basically my entire life. My mom used to use rectal suppositories on me as a baby and had to make me drink diluted prune juice to help me go.

131,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));My bad constipation began due to stress about eight years ago when I was made redundant from work and I split up with my boyfriend - all at the same time. I spent all my time at home sitting at the computer, worrying and searching the net for a cure, but at that time there were no blogs and not much useful info online.I have not been lucky with any GP. One told me that constipation was only 'hard stools' and that was nothing to worry about. No comment! I would sometimes go for eight days without visiting the toilet for number two, and I was very bloated and in a lot of pain. On a very few occasions I would have a mildly loose stomach, but I would mainly be horribly constipated, pained and confused. A colleague of mine seriously asked me if I was pregnant once, as my waistline was getting visibly bigger. I was becoming apple-shaped and really embarrassed.Knowing that I could get dependent on laxatives made me not want to use any for some time, but eventually I started using them. I would usually take them Friday evening and be able to empty my stomach on the weekend after a whole week of constipation. Eventually I had to take more of them and become dependent.I have been prescribed many different cures in turn - Lactulose, a high fiber diet, mebeverine, various stool softeners, and possibly other things that I cannot now remember. The fibers only made me bloat up more than I was already, and gave me much embarrassing wind. I once came to this website, a long time ago, and read the happy stories and kept searching for a cure. I had a rectoscopy and colonoscopy done - these were unpleasant but happily did not reveal any bad problems.I spent lots of time researching, tried yoga exercises for constipation - just search on google for these. Tried aloe vera juice. All these worked to a certain extent...until I started organizing my wedding. I was worried that I had lost my slim waistline and decided to exercise at least three times a week. This worked wonders! Please everyone, listen to me and have the will to try it.I hired a personal trainer to put me into shape for my wedding, and the incredible side effect was that after about 10 to 14 days of regular exercise I started going to the toilet regularly. This was accompanied by other little things that I did, which helped, but had not worked 100% by themselves until exercise came into the picture.Here is what I did:exercised at least three times a week (yes, not easy to fit in a busy schedule, I was often tired when arriving at the gym at 8pm). Thirty minutes cardio and 30 minutes weight training - ask a gym instructor to start withgot up very early to have time for a hot coffeedid a yoga exercise for constipation (breathing is important) before I went to bed and in the morning first thingrepeatedly told myself that 'I will definitely go in the morning after I have had my coffee'every morning I ate three tablespoons of oat-bran mixed with one tablespoon of linseed, added low fat milk and cooked in the microwave for two minutes. Some organic honey can be added to make it sweeteval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));drank as much herbal tea and water during the day as I could (for me this is not more than three cups). Drinking six cups of warm water a day did not help much by itself (and I had to run for a pee every 30 minutes at work, not nice). I cannot drink three liters of water in the morning because I drive 40 miles to work and often get stuck in traffic, so I don't like the stress of not being able to pee when I need it.In six weeks I lost about 3 or 4 kilos, mainly off my waist, and thought I looked great on the wedding day. My dress had to be taken in twice - at the hips and mainly at the waist. After the wedding we traveled for 10 days and I managed it without bad constipation although I could not exercise regularly.I have not exercised much this winter, but will start in the spring. Currently I miss a day occasionally. If I miss two days in a row I take an aloe vera tablet at night (colon cleanse - the pink-purple ones). Even if I do not go to the gym regularly now, I still  never constipate as badly as before. I remembered about this site the other day and thought I should come back here to write.Please try cardio exercise, make it a part of your lifestyle. It's the best thing for your body. Provided you are not allergic and cannot determine what's causing your constipation, I am pretty sure that exercise is the best thing you can do for yourself and combined with natural remedies, it just works!

132,"I recently saw an ear, nose and throat specialist for chronic sinus issues, and he declared it was allergies. So I went for all of the tests and lo and behold, I am allergic to wheat. My first thought was, no way can I cut that out. But I decided to truly try it after my last sinus infection, and I was amazed. I have suffered from acne my whole life, and my skin cleared, my sinuses were the best they have ever been, and my bowel movements were back to normal after being constipated for years...I truly felt good.Deciding one night I didn't care, I wanted a cheeseburger no matter the costs (and it came on a whole wheat bun!)

133,"Hi everyone! This is an update for my story in the sad tales section, and although I cannot say that I'm a happier person I definitely am more enlightened about what is going on with my body. After taking several tests, undergoing a colonoscopy and doing more research on my symptoms I discovered that I am very lactose intolerant (hence the gas resulting after eating any kind of dairy) and also fructose intolerant.Apparently my body doesn't produce the enzymes needed to break down these sugars, which also contributes to my constipation. I only drink Lactaid milk now, but the least amount of cheese makes me gassy still. I also cannot eat sweets high in corn syrup or anything containing fructose. I will soon see a nutritionist who will hopefully help me with a risk-free diet.Remember, we cannot fight what we don't know, that's why I encourage you all to try everything you can (even if it's sometimes expensive to undergo all these tests); it will help you for sure find out more about your illness.

135,"eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I am in my mid-20s and I have had IBS since I was in my late teens. It all started with two food poisoning episodes which I never quite recovered from. In the first few years my symptoms were diarrhea and gas. The symptoms then turned into chronic constipation accompanied with occasional diarrhea, something which made me go through all the laxatives I could find. They all gave me diarrhea and I could never properly go to the toilet, it was only liquid that would come out. In the end however the laxatives would all fail to even give me diarrhea and I became quite frustrated at not knowing what to do.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I have tried many things such as homeopathy, diet modification, acupuncture, Chinese herb medicine, exercise, detoxification, enemas, and as mentioned many laxatives. To make a long story short I have over the years, through a lot of trial and error, managed to find the best way to cope with my troubled bowels, and I did honestly not believe I could get this well. I pretty much believed my bowel was a lost cause.The strategy that works best for me is a combination of diet modification, digestive aids and specific mineral supplementation. So here is what I do: no grains, no refined sugar, no dairy products, not too much fruit. I keep it simple by eating a lot of vegetables, brown rice, fish, meat, berries, some nuts and occasionally some fruit. Basically this is what many people call the Stone Age diet. Then with meals I take digestive aids in the form of stomach acid, digestive enzymes, a beetroot concentrate supplement to help my bile and a bile supplement. I have been found to have low stomach acid so for me this was good, but this may vary a great deal for people. I also take omega-3, a vitamin B complex and make sure I eat healthy oils. In addition I take psyllium seed husks and probiotics.I was also found to have low magnesium (using a hair mineral test, the serum test is not good enough) and tried many oral magnesium supplements which did not help. Then I discovered magnesium oil (derived from condensed seawater) which is applied to the skin. Magnesium oil applied to the skin worked wonders for my bowels. When first starting it my bowel started to do things it had not done in years. And now I regularly apply oil to my stomach and bowel area or other areas and leave it on for half an hour to an hour making sure it does not dry out or get cold.So now when I manage to do all these things correctly I go to the toilet once a day and what comes out is normal. I almost never have diarrhea. Since calcium has the opposite effect to magnesium I make sure I do not get too much calcium from too hard waters or any other source. The magnesium that I apply to the skin has also produced some nice side effects such as almost absent period cramps and better sleep.To some it may seem like a hard regime to follow but for me it has been worth it. In addition I have put effort into detoxification which seems to have made a positive contribution. Today I function beyond what I thought was possible. That does not mean I am perfect, but compared to what it was this is great. I still experience some problems, but I mostly understand what has been going wrong and manage to correct it. It is so great to be able to a large degree control the condition and wear slim-fit clothes again.I don't know how many people could be helped by similar measures as people can be very different. For me magnesium was the key, but it was only the magnesium absorbed through the skin which would work. From all this I learned that it pays to not give up trying to find solutions when traditional medicine tells you there is nothing you can do.",,magnesium,people,oil,oil,skin,stomach,diet,food poisoning,side effect,exam

This was just by accident. An aesthetician I knew had a client with IBS who felt she had received tremendous relief and an understanding of her condition through an outstanding acupuncturist.I went once, very skeptically, to see this practitioner. As soon as she looked at me, knowing why I was there, she announced I was 'impacted', then she looked at my tongue, which was coated, and felt my pulse. The fact that this acupuncturist was so familiar with my condition, having successfully treated IBS before (and giving me references to those who had been successfully treated), was very encouraging. I continued seeing her for several weeks, on a weekly basis, for one-hour treatments.The acupuncturist also helped me in reformulating the diet I ate. She advised no 'dark' foods, such as coffees and chocolate, because these are 'hot' foods and my system was hot already. She advised several kinds of light teas, such as green tea (which I don't care for, but with jasmine, it became a treat). Also, no legumes, including re-fried, black or kidney beans because these are difficult to digest. I had eaten beans very regularly because they were 'good for me'...well, not for someone with my serious IBS. She advised no red meat and also suggested vegetables that were the colors of my intestines, oranges, yellows (such as squashes, yams, etc).This advice I have taken in earnest. I not only feel better as I continue to see my acupuncturist, but I have lost over 10lbs from my change of diet. It has not been difficult for me to change what I eat, because I can tell that by avoiding the foods mentioned above I no longer have the excruciating pain I once had. I also have much more regular bowel movements. I occasionally get some cramping if I eat the wrong foods, such as during the recent Christmas holiday season.  I notice that right away, my system is off. But I know what to do to get myself back on track.Other items to avoid are alcohol, soft drinks and regular iced tea (a 'dark' food). I didn't have any of these drinks often, so it wasn't hard to stop them altogether. At the time I first saw my acupuncturist, she also informed me I had an allergy to dairy, which I had never known. I dropped dairy altogether, including ice cream. I now use soy products in place of milk and creamers, and I replaced regular ice cream with coconut milk ice cream which is delicious - and I am truly a diehard ice cream lover. I do not like coconut and so was very wary about trying this, but now I'm a believer. You cannot taste the coconut and it is also so low in calories I can't believe I'd never heard of it as a viable alternative to real ice cream!You have to be very careful when you look for an acupuncturist, and I realize many people do not believe in them at all. I am now a firm believer but believe me when I say there are acupuncturists and there are acupuncturists. You must be careful to find one who doesn't use this treatment in addition to being a chiropractor or a practicing MD who has learned acupuncture as a sideline to his conventional practice of Western medicine.I am truly grateful to have found help for my lifetime of suffering through the worst kind of pain imaginable. To be cleared of an impaction and having lost the huge stomach I had for many years makes me feel so much better and healthier. I sleep better and have more energy and continue to slowly but surely lose weight just by eating the right kind of foods....foods that are digestible and much easier for my system to handle.E-mail Vicki:[email protected]",,acupuncturist,food,ice cream,coconut,coconut,tea,kind,kind,system,kidney bean
137,"This has been quite the year for attacking the enemy of IBS and I finally feel I am getting somewhere, although I'm not so foolish as to think that couldn't change again at any time. I've taken a multi-pronged approach and tried to come at it with both physical and psychological - and even spiritual - armory.Now I will say here that I have never suffered to the point of being totally debilitated. I have had severe constipation for almost all of my life which is at times worse than others, and recent years have seen an increase in bloating, pain and gas. My doctor thought it might be IBS or just severe constipation but either way it has gotten me down and been my sole focus for way too long.So this year I found this website and I got really tired of the whole fight. First I saw a dietician and was dumbfounded to hear that my super high diet might be the worst thing I could be doing for myself. I loathed the white bread and zero fiber cereals and peeling my apples but the bloating seemed to go down; there were no other major effects though. Around that time I found myself obsessing over every meal and noting down every day's intake which was rather sad and time-consuming and provided no enlightenment whatsoever.I wasted money on each and every miracle solution I read about online: the psyllium tasted vile and totally failed to work, aloe vera tasted cleansing but drew a blank, magnesium just produced scary side effects at the dose I had to take to do anything, slippery elm tea tasted soothing but wasn't the big cure, molasses last thing at night worked once and then never again.I spent ages researching enemas but knew there was no way I was ever going to lie on my bathroom floor holding a bag of coffee or purified water over my head. Lactulose was probably the best thing I discovered as it worked consistently and was easy to take. However I am amazed to say that I no longer need to do anything special at all and have had no bloating or problems going to the bathroom for several months.When I left the dietician I felt the best thing that had happened was that I had stopped feeling so desperate for the problem to be gone. I guess I came to rest with my body as it was a bit and stopped wanting to punch my stomach in frustration and disembowel myself. I was often uncomfortable but it wasn't agonizing pain and I could get on with my life more or less.When I kept a journal for the dietician I noticed that I was able to go to the bathroom occasionally. I was horrified at the thought of all the waste that must be increasingly backing up in my poor distended belly but decided to stop worrying about it so much since there seemed nothing I could really do and it wasn't going to kill me apparently.But the big question I kept asking myself was what my body could be trying to tell me with these symptoms. I've read a few interesting books discussing this idea; sometimes I was dubious at the notion that every little symptom down to the mouth ulcer could be a message from the psyche, but it was compelling that my chronic constipation was a signal of something deep inside that was amiss.I had read that digestive problems can signify a difficulty with digesting change. Or that constipation can be a metaphor for being stuck in a bad situation in your life that you can't move on from. Somehow this did ring true for me but I didn't know what to do with the information. However something did happen this year: I have spent the last 16 years in two difficult relationships and this year I finally got together the courage to start being honest and admitting that I need to be alone for a while and look after myself. My husband and I have embarked on a trial separation and I was astonished at first at the instant improvement in my bowel health.They say our digestive system is our second brain and we have almost as many neurons down there as up top. So we store a lot of emotion in that region and not surprisingly this can make for problems digesting our food. My mother informs me that my constipation can be traced back to my father leaving us when I was around three years old. Once after seeing the dietician I lay on the living room floor and tried to listen to what my tummy might be feeling; what I got was a terrible sadness and going into that made me feel like a tiny frightened child again. Anyway, since moving into my own place I have felt a total sense of relief and safety and this has translated into a softer, more comfortable belly.My dietician was wise enough to look at the problem holistically and we discussed all these ideas. I mentioned to her that despite pregnancy being famously a time when constipation is worse than ever, I had no problems at all. It felt like my body was working more efficiently, as it needed to for the baby, and that everything was flowing more smoothly.But psychologically, during pregnancy, I was able to let go of all control and that was what I loved more than anything else about the whole nine months. Whereas I am normally quite uptight, I felt a magical sense that something incredible was happening within me and that I could do nothing to control it, didn't need to, and didn't want to. I just sat back and let it all happen. And this is a state I am trying to return to now as I see how key it is.I am exploring my spirituality and my creative side and trying to flow with life rather than trying always to stop the flow and hold onto things as they are now. I have always hated most fairground rides and big slides on which you have no choice but to let go. I am absolutely terrified of losing all control like that. But taking care of my spiritual needs was extremely important and is helping me to feel a little safer in the world.I was born a very sensitive child and the world is not exactly an easy, nurturing environment most of the time. Or at least it hasn't felt that way to me. I have always suffered from being over-stimulated a lot of the time and I believe my guts have been affected. I may be retreating a little too much now, I don't know, but I believe I'm doing what I need to do and finally respecting myself and giving myself what I need.I really hope some of what I have written has resonated with a few of you. If so I would love to hear about it. For me, it was helpful to write all this down and to realize what I need to do to keep growing and healing. I wish you all peace and healing for your bodies, minds and spirits.E-mail Jenny:[email protected]",,constipation,body,stomach,toilet,living room,night work,side effect,email,world,pregnancy

140,"I'm 45, and I have suffered from IBS since I was seven. Not as severe it seems as many, certainly reading the postings on this website, but nonetheless for years I had a sixth sense for every toilet, planned my routes to familiar places in the context of these, and yet managed to hold down a job lecturing.The biggest blight on my life I guess was a fear of traveling; although I'd go away, I knew I'd spend half the vacation in my hotel room suffering with upset stomachs and cramps. Hot places were the very worst, on one occasion I must have spent ten of the 14 days in my room. Doctors made various diagnoses - I've had all forms of tests, cameras and so forth.My last GP said that it was IBS and that I could live with it or change my diet. Well, I tried dairy-free and gluten-free diets, I'm vegetarian anyway, yet these only gave a brief respite.Then, following a dose of campylobacter food poisoning in November 2001, I was given alverine citrate - a miracle happened.

I'm male and in my late twenties. The last few days have been really bad (although I have had it just as bad in the past) so I decided to look on the web for any help I could find. Wow, and I thought I had it worse than anybody else...I never realized how many other sufferers there were and how widespread IBS is.I thought that when I was stuck on the toilet, experiencing the most severe cramps, cold sweating buckets, going light headed, thinking I was about to pass out from the pain, feeling like I was about to throw up, I was the only one.There is some comfort in knowing that I'm not the only one and, whilst my cramps are severe, I do get relief from them. I can go several months without experiencing any problems, but can then go several months with them. You would think that I could look at my lifestyle and work it out...well, I'm still trying to work it out but I believe it has a lot to do with my psychological state.I say this because although I don't get too stressed out at any one moment (ie: getting angry or fed-up) I do have general worries about money and life. I tend to find when I'm not worrying about these things I don't get the pain as much if at all. It's easier said than done of course, I can't just stop worrying about money or my future, but being aware of these things seems to help - being optimistic and knowing that everything is only temporary (I know - easier said than done).When I do have severe cramps thinking to myself that either in a few minutes or a few hours I will feel relief can be of comfort sometimes. I have been taking Colpermin (peppermint) as a preventative which often helps and for a while I took painkillers which I thought helped. I have just had a non-serious operation and been given some very strong painkillers and I have the IBS pain right now, I know different painkillers do different things so it's hard to tell.Anyway, coming back to the psychological aspect. I spent Christmas just gone in America and ate all the worst foods you can imagine, steaks, burgers (with pink middles!), pizzas, more burgers, spicy foods, burritos etc.Did I have any pain? Not one bit, but as soon as I got back home...pain. I'm self-employed and for the time I was in the States put everything to do with home and work out of mind and I believe this helped a lot.I also spent the second year of my degree in the states (three years ago) and suffered from the pain far less than I do here in England. My main assumption is that my state of mind in general has a big effect on my IBS. I studied psychology at university and was very into hypnosis and all kinds of alternative psych.Trying to control stress levels is easier said than done, but I think it helps to be optimistic about your IBS. I know it's hard, and I'm sure worrying about the state of the world doesn't help.However, I think that just being aware about any 'life worries' you may have and thinking positively about trying to sort them out can help (rather than worrying). I believe strongly in hypnosis and the power of the mind, and you know what...just typing out this story the pain has been alleviated somewhat! It's hard to know whether the pain was going to go now or not but I don't really care...just a little while ago I was in agony.Worrying about IBS doesn't help either...reading some of these stories is comforting some of the time (knowing I'm not alone) but not others. I think if you are able to, exercise can help not only because it is healthy which in turn can make your 'insides healthy', it also takes your mind off the pain. And this seems to be a key for me.There is one thing that seems to always take the pain away but it only lasts for the duration of the activity, it's too embarrassing to mention what it is and it's also very impractical. It is, however, something that supports my theory of 'taking the mind off the pain' (although I'm sure the physical part plays its own effect).I'm not saying that when I have the pain I can think of something else just like that, but trying to think positively in general about life if I can may help. I hear UEL are doing some research into the psychological effects of IBS and I am really interested in finding out what they discover.I steer well clear of curries and Chinese foods as these always trigger it off, don't really drink caffeine any more as tea in the mornings gave me mild cramps. I know that I will get on top of this thing - I have done before. Knowing that for me, it has a lot to do with my state of mind keeps me positive about one day sorting it out for good.I think it's worth the effort trying to find if there is anything to do with your state of mind in general. I don't mean the guy at the supermarket checkout pissing you off on a Sunday afternoon, but things like worrying about money, what your future will be like, problems with a spouse, or not being able to find one even. Those sort of things.It was useful for me to look at things like yoga and tai chi which help calm you in general. Going out for walks and trying to use that time to forget about any problems. I did tai chi for two terms and don't remember having the pain during that time.It also sorted out other pains - it's a physical meditation and I recommend it - mental relaxation, exercise, and physical relaxation all in one! (I had to stop because I couldn't afford the lessons but plan to take it up again and I want to start yoga soon as well.)I have no real 'quick fix' but when things are 'OK in general' I get no problems and can eat pretty much what I want. Sorry if this story comes across as all well and good but not as easy in practice, it's just my theory and it can't hurt to try and keep a psychological diary as well as a food diary can it?",,pain,state,tai chi,cramp,food,psychological,tale,painkiller,analgesic,newspaper
142,"When I think back, the earliest indications of this came from cigarette smoking in my late teens and early 20s. I carried mail when first out of high school. Have a cigarette early in the morning, go to the toilet, carry my route for the day. It seemed an easy way to control my bowels. Later, the bowel effects went away; but I began a gradually increasing problem with indigestion. Cigarettes, alcohol, and diet all contributed. By my late 30s I had had a particularly bad bought with gastritis and a gallbladder attack where I passed the stones.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Then, one morning in my early 40s, I lit a cigarette at work and immediately trotted off to the bathroom. Came out, somewhat stricken by the intensity of the experience, had another cigarette and another run to the toilet. After the third cigarette and the third case of D, I began to see a correlation.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));Thus began my daily struggle with bowels and digestion. Cut back on smoking and finally quit in my late 40s. By that time I had dietary triggers all over the place. Began to experience acid reflux to top it all off.In 1998, stricken by x-rays that showed evidence of cholesterol blockages, I began to take a grapeseed-based supplement called Provex CV, to improve my cardiovascular system. Within the first couple of weeks I began to notice a change in my bowels. A little more control, a little longer time to get to the toilet.After about a month I knew it was having a positive effect. At some point I also realized that my indigestion had calmed down. I have never had another case of reflux since then.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Over the next year consistency, motility and frequency all improved until I had reached a point that it was no longer an issue. Still my system has continued to improve. Three times a day. Twice a day. This January I began to add a little fiber to my diet and reduced it to once a day. This fall I began to add omega three oil (fish oil) to my diet and the consistency of my movements truly looks normal.Oh, yes. My cholesterol, which always got me a lecture from my doctors since the first reading over 20 years ago, has not been a problem since the fall of 1998. I don't know what percentage of us will have the same level of relief with this, but I have helped others control their diarrhea with the same supplement.E-mail Mark:[email protected]",,cigarette,toilet,email,diet,fish oil,indigestion,flux,cholesterol,system,plug
143,"I have been suffering from IBS for the past six years. I had problems with all the trigger foods like alcohol, coffee, Chinese food, spicy foods 
etc. I had always relied on Imodium and sometimes it did not work if I took it too much. I had to be very careful with my Imodium usage.I was feeling very depressed and I had anxiety problems. This was especially bad because I had to travel and it was really giving me sleepless nights months before my travel.I recently came across this website and read the story posted by Linda. She had mentioned that she was taking calcium carbonate and it really helped her. I decided to try it. Instead of going for Caltrate Plus, I tried Tums. I took one in the morning along with a spoonful of flaxseed.It was like magic, all my bloating feeling disappeared and I had no diarrhea. I also stopped drinking coffee. I have been trying it for a week 
and it seems to work, except on New Year's Eve when I went to a party and decided to have a couple of drinks. Even though I had taken Tums I had an IBS attack the next day. I suffered for the whole day.So, in essence, no alcohol, no coffee and taking a Tums in the morning before breakfast seems to have fixed my problem. I am going to be very careful on what I eat and continue with my one Tums. Good luck to anybody who wants to try this.",,food,coffee,alcohol,breakfast,trigger,breakfast,attack,attack,attack,attack
144,"I am writing to inform you of a way in which my IBS symptoms have been relieved. I have suffered from diarrhea-predominant IBS for around eight years, since suffering from a viral infection.I have had the usual medical tests, eg:sigmoidoscopyetc to rule out any other condition or disease, and basically my life has been a living hell, particularly over the last year where a normal day for me was to have around five or six bowel movements a day (accompanied by lots of pain and bloating.) My worst day was about a month ago where I had 15 bowel movements. (Sorry that this information is so graphic but with this condition you learn to overcome your loss of dignity!)As you will no doubt realize this has made holding down a job very difficult, but luckily I have an employer who has been fairly understanding 
about this condition (most of the time!). I recently decided to go back to my GP, and she prescribed 30mg of Codeine three times a day to try and stop my bowel movements from being so frequent. This has helped to reduce the number of bowel movements that I have per day dramatically.I have also tried a supplement called Esdifan which contains Calcium, vitamin B12 and a mineral called Zeolite. This has definitely helped with the pain and the bloating that I would suffer from. This condition has dominated my life for the last eight years but now I actually feel hopeful

145,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));After reading some of these stories I realize that I may not have as severe a case of IBS as some people. But I've definitely had my share of racing for the toilet, leaving parties and dinners early, running red lights on the way home, etc. One time I had to go so bad in this awful bar with the worst toilet in all of Chicago. There was no stall and the toilet was disgusting. To top it off, there was no toilet paper so you know what I did? I took off my underwear and got it wet in the sink and used that! I had to throw out my underwear and go commando the rest of the night!Women - I will dare to say that you do have it a tiny, tiny bit easier because men's rooms rarely have stall doors and guys routinely pee all over the seat. Not fun. Also, women disappear into the bathroom for hours to fix their make-up, have a chat, etc. We men never know what you're doing in there! Whereas if a guy is in there longer than 15 seconds, everybody knows he's taking a crap!Anyway, on to the self-help advice. The thing that I found has helped me the most recently is that I started to get a bit scientific about paying 
attention to my body and reaction to foods. This probably sounds gross, but I try to identify the food when it comes back out! Some foods are easy, like corn for example. The thing that this helped me to discover is that not only do foods have various negative and positive effects, but their effects have different timing.It took me a long while to figure out that spicy food was messing up my system because it doesn't cause problems until about two days later. Whereas eating red meat or drinking coffee will cause an almost instant reaction for me. Eating a green salad, on the other hand, is extremely helpful - but it doesn't start to have an effect for two or three days.I don't know why this is, but once I started paying more attention it has been a major change for me. I eat a lot of salads and avoid spicy food now and that has had a huge, huge effect. Also, I like knowing that I am taking a healthy approach as opposed to eating a bunch of garbage and then trying to reverse nature with a pill. I know everyone's situation is different and medication is the right choice for some people. But for me if I can remove the cause that is preferable to treating the symptoms.The other related problem for me is the feeling that I have to go urgently, but then I can't go. That one probably messes me up the most because that's when you have to go to the bathroom over and over and never get any relief. At least with diarrhea you get it over with! The constipation is really torture that keeps on going.I've noticed that the nerves and feelings in my digestive system are sensitive but not exactly precise. For instance, the spicy food - I'll start to feel like an emergency is coming on within about eight hours of eating. But it's only working its way through my system at this point. I won't be ready to actually crap it out yet (excuse the grossness) but I'll have cramps and feel like I have to go.My colon seems to just send a generic distress signal to my brain and it's hard to distinguish between that and truly having to go. I might feel this way for a whole 24 hours before the inevitable happens. So, I try now to be very sensitive to my body and sometimes I can feel the difference now. Though I still have uncomfortable cramps it does save me a few fruitless trips to the bathroom.I've also found that if I'm at home where I can go to the bathroom whenever I want at a moment's notice, I'll try not to go to the bathroom until I absolutely have to. A lot of times the cramps will just pass if you don't try to force it. If I try to go constantly, it's always worse. If I wait as long as possible, that seems to let my system 'catch up' or whatever. Of course, it's better to avoid the bad food in the first place, but we can't be good all the time!I hope that my information is helpful to someone. It's probably just common sense, but nobody ever gave me this advice, I feel like I've had to figure it out for myself.",,toilet,food,system,cramp,people,body,salad,guy,man,woman
146,"More than a story about how much I have suffered from IBS-D I would like to take this time to write something a little more meaningful. I offer you my philosophy on the matter. I would firstly like to say thank you to the community of IBS sufferers who frequent this site and especially to Sophie for her ongoing project of maintaining it. Many times, when I have had particularly bad moments, I have found myself in a sweat searching desperately through web pages looking for anything to help myself. Strangely enough, I always end up back here at IBS Tales.I always used to be frustrated when I got an attack, blaming everything from people not being understanding, or the opposite of people caring too much, to the point that it aggravated me. I blamed my own stupidity for eating something or just blamed myself for not being 'normal'. I guess that is in fact the most frustrating part. More than the pain and more than the social complications that IBS offers, knowing that once upon a time I was normal tortured me the most.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2']));I could never understand why I was afflicted by this dysfunctional syndrome. I swear to you I can remember clearly every detail of the day I 
had my first attack. I can also remember the day I sat in a medical room listening to a doctor clinically describing that he couldn't measure my pain but he understood how horrible it must be, and yet was unable to help me. At the time I thought well, he could make me feel better by not charging me…(bad attempt at humor).eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));That was the turning point in my experience. I had the results in my hands, the colonoscopy biopsies and the blood hormone analysis. No matter how much I believed I must have something there was nothing out of the ordinary. I looked at the prescriptions the doctor had sent me and then I looked around at my loving girlfriend whose worried face is something I will never forget.I felt like a failure that day. It was funny though, but it was that day that I realized something which had been so obvious for the very first time. Every time I had been to see a specialist during a hard time, amazingly the symptoms started to dissipate shortly afterwards. I came to the conclusion that although it must be impossible that everything I had was in my head, at least part of it 'could' have been. So I made a resolution to remove that 'could be' factor from my life.I got strategic, I analytically analyzed my life. Where was my main source of stress coming from? How often did I get attacks and when did they get worse? What was my recovery time like, three days, four days, five days after the first symptom? Was my underweight issue really that big of a trauma for me? How much attention did I pay to people who couldn't possibly understand my problem telling me I should just eat more? When did I make time for me?Around this time I was introduced to Michael Mahoney’s hypnotherapy recordings. Supplemented with my new proactive view on life, I started to build a sense of confidence I had not felt in God knows how long. My symptoms did in fact improve a bit, definitely not to a point where I could measure it statistically, but I did and still do feel an improvement.More than anything, these tools which I armed myself with helped me to become more relaxed and a much less pessimistic person. I don't have all the answers, but being at peace with yourself and enjoying every moment, even it is painful is part of the key to starting an improvement in the quality of your life. Something that no drug or doctor or therapy can do for you.IBS is a bit like a journey, and every person's experience is different. What you need to understand, especially if you have only recently been 
diagnosed with IBS, is that you and only you have the power to heal or better yourself. That means, finding a strategic way to approach your problems and yet finding a balance so that you aren't always focusing on the problem consciously or subconsciously. Fighting against the problem, refusing to accept the facts, will only make your problems worse. Make the necessary sacrifices to feel better - it is worth it.Positivity is the door right in front of you which can change your life and make you a better person in every sense. If you read this and you have been suffering, I beg you not to get aggravated at those words. They are not easy to accept, believe me I know it is not easy. But it is true. I hurt myself so much before I truly understood the saying that no-one cares about you as much as you do.

147,"After having gallbladder surgery I began having frequent bowel movements after meals. It seemed that the more spicy and greasy foods triggered it. My doctor told me that I have IBS so I have watched my diet for the past year.Then I read that some people who have had gallbladder surgery have too much bile in their system which triggers bowel movements. I then learned of a medication, Colestid, which is used by IBS sufferers and those with my condition. I take one to two tablets per day and I have found that it controls my BMs to the point that I am back to normal.

148,"I suffered for years, not only from IBS-D, but from anxiety and panic attacks. While the anxiety and panic dealt with other issues, one of the 
things that reinforced my anxiety was my constant stomach trouble. I was trapped in a cycle where I would get anxious when my stomach hurt, and my stomach hurt when I got anxious.I was able to deal with the anxiety and panic through Zoloft and therapy, but my stomach trouble persisted. I had to plan my entire life around my IBS. I felt scared to do things I love, like going out to eat, or traveling, because I was afraid I was going to get sick. My doctor suggested Fibercon, and this did work for a time, but it was not as effective as I would have liked.I switched to Lomotil last year and it worked very well at first. Even with the Lomotil though, the IBS seemed to 'break through' on occasion for days, and then it would subside. The Lomotil eventually stopped working completely and for an entire week I was in total agony. I was going to the bathroom so much I wondered if I needed to be hospitalized.My mother suggested Imodium, which I had never considered before. After all, I had always thought that Imodium couldn't be taken for more then two days at a time. After some research I found that this was utterly false and that Lomotil, not Imodium is not recommended for long periods of time.I've started taking one or two Imodium every day and my IBS symptoms have disappeared.

The only problem is that it is, as always, aggravating my IBS. I live in the UK and have had IBS (diagnosed recently) since 2000 following a trip to Guatemala where foolishly I went swimming in Lake Tikal. Lake Tikal is a freshwater lake, but - unknown to me at the time - is pumped full of raw sewage. Needless to say I caught what I believed was a very bad case of food poisoning.After Guatemala (and some close toilet calls) we flew to New York. I was still feeling very ill...needless to say passing through customs in USA with your trousers loaded is not an easy or fun thing to do! They were however very nice, and I ended up being sent to the hospital where I was looked after very well for 24 hours.The doctors took blood etc and after being rehydrated I was released and advised that I did not have anything tropical, just a bad case of food poisoning. Well, with lots of Imodium I made it through the holiday.Back in the UK three weeks later the symptoms continued to get worse. The pain was becoming unbearable and I headed off to the doctors again. After a stool sample I was diagnosed with food poisoning and put on some meds that eventually cleared things up for a while.I returned to work and all was well until the Friday night. Yep I had a pizza, followed by toffee cheesecake and ice cream, all washed down with beer...my friends thought I had got lost in the bathroom at one point. The pain was incredible and I soiled myself on the way home in the taxi, which cost an extra £50. I then spent the entire night strapped to the toilet in immense pain...this took two days to pass.I believed that it was a bout of food poisoning again, but then I was free of symptoms for a while till the next time I had a night out. I began 
to put two and two together and dropped many things from my diet until I had relatively few incidents, and these were normally after or during a night out - so were anticipated on the most part.Then two years ago I had to get my gallbladder out, and since then I have been suffering daily. Constant bloating - sometimes I can eat and my gut distends so much that I look pregnant! Cramping and pain that is more severe than my attacks of pancreatitis! Cold sweats, pasty skin, lower back pain and trapped wind (oh boy does that hurt). Oh and the uncontrollable diarrhea and dehydration!But I am not going to let the bloody thing win...This is what I do! Medication - not all at once obviously - Nexium as an anti-spasmodic drug, 
Omeprazol is a brilliant anti-acid, Codeine helps fight the pain, and Imodium to try and make them stools hard.Prevention - avoiding all dairy (but hard cheese), caffeine, carbonated drinks, white bread, sugary sweets, chocolate, alcohol, smoking and smokers (thank-you Scotland for making most places smoke free), bacon, pork, spicy, rich or frozen foods. Grilling all foods on the George Foreman. Drinking plenty of water.Sanity saving - playing sport, staying fit. Keep going to work, or your brain will rot. Do have the nights out and indulge sometimes, just be prepared and take precautions after/during. Tell your friends and family and work about it. Once it's out it isn't the dirty secret you think it is, people do understand and if they don't well that's their loss for being ignorant not yours.The last thing to remember is it isn't your fault...there isn't a cure (yet!) but you guys are alive so live.

150,"I am a 26 year-old who was diagnosed with IBS after numerous intensive tests and visits to my gastroenterologist about four years ago. During the first year of IBS, I couldn't bear the pain and suffering. By the grace of God, after about a year, this so called flare-up had ended and I was pain-free for nearly two and a half years. Basically, during those years, I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Well, this was fine and dandy until about four months ago. This time, the flare-up was back with a vengeance. I studied, using the internet and this website as a guide, and found what I call a great solution to ease the suffering and/or pain. My solution...I'm on Bentyl 10mg three times a day. I wake up in the morning, and take my Bentyl an hour or so before I eat something with 8-16oz water. Fifteen minutes before I eat, I take an acidophilus caplet with 8-16oz water. You can get these at any pharmacy or Trader Joe's store.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));For breakfast, I usually eat something light such as two plain toasted pieces of white bread and a banana. Stick to Heather Van Vorous' IBS cheat sheet. Then, 15 minutes before I eat lunch, I take another acidophilus. Today it was grilled chicken, rice and steamed green beans, no butter on anything, but the chicken was marinated in a delicious non-spicy Hawaiian marinade. An hour or so after lunch, I drink a cup of decaffeinated green tea. Two hours after that, it's time for my second dose of Bentyl with 8-16oz water. I try to take this every seven or eight hours as directed.After work, I head to the gym and run/workout on the treadmill. When I get home, I take my third acidophilus 15 minutes before dinner. This time for dinner I incorporate a little more insoluble fiber into my diet. Lastly, before bed I take my last and final Bentyl of the day with 8-16oz water.The other factor to consider is that I drink room temperature water frequently all day. Again, this is not a cure but simply a solution that I found is working well and I am greatly satisfied. My pain is very mild, sometimes even faint, and my gas, bloating, etc has pretty much dissipated. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being extreme pain, I'm about 1-2 now.

I did however have difficult teenage years socially as I was bullied and, with hindsight, developed a social phobia. Although I went to an all boys school and was having difficulties coming to terms with being gay, the bullying did not take the form of homophobia.My first relationship started in September 1994 and I started university in October 1995. In early 1997 it was clear that my partner and I were growing apart and so I split up with him. At the end of l997 I met P. I believe P was my first true love and it was when he split up with me in about August 1998 that my IBS symptoms began in full.I remember a few weeks after splitting up with him I was seeing someone else and I had eaten a bagel and I had the most awful stomach ache the next day. These stomach aches did not go away and I remember trying to eat more fiber to see if that would help but it didn't.I started my new university (I was to study a PhD) in October 1998. I remember through 1998 and 1999 having an upset stomach and douching, as I thought the pain was constipation, though this did help a bit. Unfortunately I tended to do this before I went out and I tended to have an 'accident' just before I got to the pub/club.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I was still pretty messed up over the split with P and on New Year's Eve I did my first E. In 1999 I feel that I was very unhappy and started smoking and doing speed and E. During this period I discovered that taking drugs got rid of the stomach pain. Throughout that year I was still seeing P and we were sleeping together, and eventually we started going out again. However towards the end of the year, I was taking drugs to get rid of the pain so that I would feel like sex.Unfortunately, although I was doing all that was required for my PhD, I was also required to go to France, which as I did not speak French and was still socially phobic was too difficult for me and so I dropped out at the end of 1999.In 2000, P started going a bit crazy and I was feeling trapped and so we split up. Although I split up with him, I was devastated. In March 2000, my life began to improve as I got a good graduate job and bought my own flat. I also started to go to the doctor to talk about my stomach aches and was diagnosed with IBS and prescribed Colofac (mebeverine hydrochloride) and a soluble fiber. These did little to ease my symptoms and I remember drinking too much to ease the symptoms.I started a relationship with S sometime in 2001. I do not think I was particularly fond of him but I was very lonely. I changed jobs in 2002 and he moved with me. I really hated the new place I was working and my IBS was progressively getting worse. I  was also beginning to seriously dislike S as he never seemed to do anything except lie about the house (he did not work or do house work) but felt that no-one else would have me because of my stomach aches.In 2003, I finally took control of my life and split up with S. I also began to look on the internet to try to work out how I could improve my symptoms. I cut out gluten and things started to improve. I was also running and going to the gym. I was however extremely lonely and was finding it very hard to make new friends. I also changed jobs  to try to improve my happiness at work.At the beginning of 2004, I met someone very special on the internet. We talked for weeks both online and on the phone and both became obsessed with each other. He lived quite a long way away and it would have been difficult for us to meet. We first met in February 2004 and he moved in with me soon after (and we are still together). Although my feelings for him were not as intense as those for P, they are much deeper and broader and I feel that he is my soul mate.Unfortunately I began to be bullied by my line manager in June 2004 and in 2005, although I was still looking for my IBS triggers, my symptoms were getting a lot worse. Fortunately I found out that not only was I sensitive to foods but also to certain chemicals (things like some detergents, fabric conditioners and varnishes) and once I avoided those my health improved.So all in all I have discovered that cutting out the following helps my IBS symptoms:glutenmilksoyabuckwheatwashing powders/liquids (ie: do not put clothes out to dry in the home)fabric conditioners (as above)new furniture (air new furniture or buy metal or old).I again changed sections at work but continued to be bullied. I resigned in 2007 and started a new job in a great place.So overall, cutting out the above has helped significantly. That is not to say I do not get stomach aches, but they are manageable.

As with other IBS-D people, half of my attention during social events was always on the toilet door. I found myself constantly worrying whether it would be occupied or not, what people will hear when I am inside, etc… It was really exhausting.I could manage long journeys by not eating and taking Imodium before them, but these actions didn't help with the horrible distress and small panic attacks which awaited me on the bus or in the car. What a loss if I think about how much I could have enjoyed, the nice view or a long and calm sleep as most people do. But I tried not to miss any events because of IBS.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2']));After a couple of embarrassing events, I decided to learn a relaxation technique where I can visualize situations and prepare myself for them. 
Unfortunately the psychologist who taught me this convinced me of the delusion that it is 'all is in your mind, this is not a body thing'. Subsequently the technique helped me a lot to fight the panic attacks, but couldn't help the body functions heal.These years were when I became religious. If I only take the psychological benefits from being religious, it helps me understand that not every event, not even within my body, is always in my control. I have to accept that if I was destined to suffer from this syndrome, I have to firmly keep on healing myself, because I can learn a lot from it about my body and soul.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));I saw that being in the city and the stress of work caused a lot of suffering from IBS. I decided to get out and move to another country, into the desert. As an engineer, until then I didn't know what it meant to do physical work on the fields. This decision was part of my thinking that I won't let IBS have control over me, and I won't let nice things pass because of it.A year ago I decided to see a gastro specialist. She diagnosed me with lactose intolerance and IBS, and gave me some medications. But instead of taking them I went to see a doctor who was also an expert in homeopathy. She collected all of the information including my health history and family relations, bodily and psychological reasons for IBS. She gave me argentum nitricum and aloe, and other treatments. Because of them, most of the body symptoms of IBS left me. I still have problems with distress in social events and journeys, but I think it won't last long.E-mail Peter:[email protected]",,event,body,attack,attack,attack,attack,people,lactose intolerance,email,expert
155,"I have had dyspepsia (excess stomach acid) on and off for about 15 years, and it has been worst for the past three years. Several months ago I developed IBS symptoms and my GI doctor confirmed that IBS was probably what I had. My symptoms were less severe than a lot of people and consisted mostly of bloating and constant pain with some diarrhea. Symptoms came and went in three or four-day cycles.I tried the IBS diet by Heather Van Vorous, and it kind of worked. The best thing about that diet was that I ate healthier (although my IBS was not cured). I then tried the hypnotherapy CDs (IBS Audio Program 100) from Great Britain, and those worked better than the diet. I also used meditation and yoga (which I have practised for years), which worked on my IBS-related stress but not really on the IBS.However, the breakthrough for me was unexpected. I was on a camping trip about two months after my first symptoms had developed and I stopped at a beautiful overlook. The sun was coming up, the weather was perfect and nobody was there but me. It was one of those perfect moments after a couple of tough months struggling with IBS.Suddenly, I had this feeling from who knows where, and I said out loud 'I am not going to let this IBS run my life starting right now'. I said it right from my heart, and I have never felt stronger about any statement that I have ever made. I felt like that statement was from something larger than myself.Since that moment, my symptoms have mostly disappeared. The other day, I tried this with the dyspepsia and it has worked, although the experience was not nearly as strong. I guess in the end, I no longer give IBS any attention nor do I feed it any mental energy. I don't follow the IBS diets, although I do eat healthily and avoid certain foods/beverages.Obviously, it is not so easy for many IBS sufferers, and it is impossible not to give attention to your guts when they are ripping apart. However, I did find that not giving it attention was the best remedy for me. I am fairly convinced that it will not come back in force for me. Don't infer that I think 'it is all in your head'. I don't - I am just sharing what worked for me. Good luck to everyone.E-mail Jeff:[email protected]",,diet,email,statement,camping,head,head,remedy,beverage,food,energy

As you can guess, it limited my social life and I had some really close embarrassing moments during those 12 years.During those 12 years the doctors would listen and said that it was IBS and they always gave me a diarrhea medicine. On 4 January of this year, my daughter said that she had a friend who had the same symptoms and that I should be checked for an allergy to wheat/gluten.Instead of getting checked out, I cut out all of wheat-based foods - breads, cookies, donuts, cakes, soups, some candies, some sauces and soups, all cereals other than cornflakes, and on and on...within one week of my removal of wheat products from my meals, my diarrhea went away. And I have only had diarrhea twice in eight months! I'm a normal person again. Just think, after 12 years I cured myself with the help of a friend.

However with every passing day the situation was getting worse, with five to 10 loose motions every day, bloating and gas along with other symptoms.I asked my GI specialist about all possible causes including celiac disease. The answer was always that celiac is rare in India. However I finally decided to go on a completely gluten-free diet. To my relief I am observing a week-by-week improvement in symptoms.

I found, by the process of elimination, that preservatives in foods really ensure a guaranteed 'crash' for me. Over the years, I have learned to read the labels and avoid preservatives...all kinds that are manmade.Sugar and salt are good preservatives that I can tolerate but not nitrites in bacon and preserved meats, and the 221 and the 223 and the sulfites and benzoates that are added to foods and drinks. If I am very vigilant, I can go through two weeks without pain at all, until the next trip-up...although the bloating and the wind are still there.

162,"I have had IBS for about two years now, with symptoms such as mild and dull pain throughout the body, irregular bowel movements and severe heartburn just to name a few. By far the two best natural remedies for my IBS are organic chicken vegetable soup and yoga. I ate organic chicken vegetable soup for a week accompanied by a light diet of IBS safe foods and Bigelow peppermint tea. The diet sent my IBS into remission for three to four months, until I reverted back to my junk food diet, but I believe if I had stuck to my diet the remission would have lasted much longer.This is the organic chicken vegetable soup recipe. Every ingredient must be 100% organic. First, put bottled water in a saucepan, a third of the volume, and put on max heat. Add whole organic chicken, and as soon as it starts boiling decrease heat. When you see some grey foam starting to develop, just remove it with a suitable tool. Do this a few times until it is mostly gone; this will take a few minutes. Add salt (kosher or sea salt, avoid regular salt) and pepper and let the chicken slightly boil for 30 min. Test by putting a knife or fork through the chicken - it has to be soft.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2']));After you put the water on the heat you can start cutting vegetables (do this in advance to save time). The vegetables are: one or two carrots, two celery sticks (organic, as regular celery has a lot of pesticides and other chemicals), one mid-sized onion, two mid-sized zucchini, one mid-sized yellow squash (if you have it), one tomato or one tablespoon of tomato paste, and one potato (take the skin off and cut into cubes).eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));After 30 minutes boiling the chicken add all the vegetables (don't cut them too small) and cook on low to medium heat so everything is slightly boiling for 10 minutes. You can add other herbs if you want - Italian seasoning, parsley, dill etc. The soup is ready when you try a piece of potato and it's soft. Turn everything off and let it stand and cool for one hour.Yoga does incredible wonders for IBS. My father had mild to severe IBS when he was younger. He started doing yoga (consistently - on a daily basis) and his IBS went away completely in seven years. He started when he was 24 and he is now 54, and has had very few symptoms over the years (mainly due to certain foods that irritate his stomach).Yoga also does wonders for stress and anxiety (my anxiety and stress went away just after two weeks of breathing exercises, which in turn got rid of many of my IBS symptoms). I would recommend this excellent book to get you started: Yoga: Mastering the Basics. A healthy diet of IBS safe foods is highly recommended to help speed up the healing process.",,chicken,vegetable,plant,diet,soup,food,heat,heat,stress,tomato
163,"I have been suffering from irritable bowel for years and it has sometimes been debilitating. After numerous doctor visits and tests and numerous treatment options (some which helped a bit like Paxil and a change of diet) I found that the best results were obtained from assuming that the basis for my problem was small bowel bacterial overgrowth, even though the hydrogen breath test was negative. My gastroenterologist still felt that this was my problem, along with possible microscopic colitis.Here is what helps me tremendously: little or no sugar and limited fruits, especially very sweet ones. Plenty of fluids (of course). Plain oat meal for breakfast with an egg or banana and tea. No coffee or very weak and limited coffee. No snacking on junk like potato chips; if I must snack I have a small sandwich with cheese or something.No milk or ice cream (cheese is OK and maybe a little milk in tea of coffee if tolerated). Pepto-Bismol every day: I started with one pill three times a day and cut back. I currently take two every morning and that's all I need, but when the IBS was out of control I gulped from a bottle. I initially kept Imodium (or a prescription drug) around.The result of the above is no cramping, no gas (unless I cheat), no running to the bathroom four-plus times a day (I am down to one or two max now).

164,"I had mild IBS without knowing it from the ages of 17 to 23. From age 24 to 29 (now) I've had serious IBS-D that comes back every few months.

Desipramine (Norpramin, Pertofrane) worked to stop the pain or diarrhea but had unacceptable side effects.Treatments that had no effect include Flagyl (metronidazole), Cipro, amoxicillin and Diflucan (fluconazole). Bentyl addresses the pain and diarrhea but not the bloating and discomfort. A two-week program of Xifaxan worked (but has anti-bacteria resistant strain risks).Treatment that were minimally effective, but sometimes saw no improvement include non-psyllium husk fiber supplements, golden seal root, black walnut hull, enteric-coated peppermint oil, Imodium, Gas-X and Pepto-Bismol.I have identified some foods as triggers, including ibuprofen (one pill can start a bout), caffeine, alcohol (one drink can start a bout), lactose-containing products (I'm lactose intolerant), too much sugar, too much fructose, too much artificial sweetener and generally eating too much or too fast. Other triggers are waking up from deep sleep, not getting sunshine (sunshine actually lessens my pain), lack of sleep, irregular sleep, smoking and general stress.At least for the people with IBS-D, I'm sure the information here will be very useful. Bentyl addresses the symptoms of diarrhea and severe pain but not the gassiness or the apparent underlying infection or bacterial overgrowth. I've yet to have a bout that was not knocked out by Xifaxan followed by probiotics.I think that, had I known these things, I would not have lost five years of my life being an unfocused PhD student, then later an unfocused worker in all types of careers, being limited in productivity by a general toilet/urgency anxiety and lack of energy from internal hemorrhoids/blood and liquid number twos five to 20 times a day every day for three to 20 week runs, a few times a year, every year.I'm finally starting on a path of making sure I'm insured so when problems arise, I'm on probiotics, psyllium, and have an appointment with a gastroenterologist for a prescription of Xifaxan and Bentyl.

165,"I was diagnosed with IBS after swine flu knocked my immune system flat on its back. Within a span of months I caught numerous stomach flus and Lyme disease. I was also diagnosed with hugely swollen lymph nodes in my GI tract and H. pylori gastritis. I thought the nightmare was over when I was treated for the H. pylori, but even after that I had awful stomach cramps.I would often get hit so hard with dizziness and nausea before having to run to the bathroom that I became extremely phobic of leaving the house. I outright refused to go to restaurants because I was so scared that my next meal would set me off. If anyone tried to coax me to go out or, God forbid, eat out with them, I would burst into tears from the anxiety of even thinking of leaving the house.When I was diagnosed with IBS, finally, and told to cut gluten out of my diet, I began to get better. I was prescribed hyoscyamine and that coupled with my new diet saw me improve so much. Slowly I felt better and began to eat out again with little fear of attacks. The hyoscyamine didn't help my panic attacks, though (I think it made them worse), so I'm now on methscopolamine bromide. This can bind me up a bit, but it has greatly helped my cramps, panic, pain and urgency. I still make sure I know where the bathroom is at all times, but I'm much improved from a year ago.I've topped off the new diet and pills with supplements. I take a huge multivitamin with probiotics, slippery elm when my stomach is upset from an attack, and I have found that thyroid supplements (I have hyperthyroid and take KLB6) have decreased my IBS attacks even further.It's not perfect; sometimes I still have to dash out of a stressful class or disappear in the middle of an anxiety-inducing test, but I would like everyone to know that there is always hope of decreasing your attacks and making life livable.

Isn't that something that just women get?'I am 44 years old and I have had IBS since shortly after graduating from college, 22 years ago. Half my life. Untreated, I can go three, four, five days or even a week between bowel movements, though there will be bloating, pain, and many unsuccessful attempts in between. During this in-between time it won't be too bad, but as the days pass, going out becomes like a combined game of Russian roulette and musical chairs.One thing is for sure, when the time comes there is no reasoning with it - find a bathroom or else. Once safely behind closed doors, I give in to the spasm and all hell breaks loose. It feels as if my intestines have been tied in knots. The spasms and movements seem to come in waves and the pain is tremendous. Than it backs off a bit and the temptation is to get up and resume my life, but I can't. I know that in five minutes or so the spasm will return, worse than the one before it.This can go on for a half hour or more before I am permitted to leave. On a bad day I can expect about three such visits in a three or four-hour period before it is over and I am wrecked, and the cycle of constipation starts over again.The damned thing rules your life. I have had to abandon my full shopping cart in the middle of the food store to rush home to the bathroom, with my kids in tow. I am afraid to do anything outside of my routine. Vacations terrify me. Work is tolerable because, thank God, I work in a family business and they understand when it is one of 'my days'. How could I ever deal with an office environment?It is bad enough that my employees see me disappear into the bathroom for a half hour or more at a time.

Not pleasant, but there is minimal cramping and no spasm, no intestinal knots.On the weekend I must get up early to take it or a large part of the day will be shot.

I suffer from alternating D and C and I have been a sufferer for several decades, but I am doing fairly well nowadays. In August 2000 I was medically retired from employment due to the IBS. I was mostly housebound/bedridden for the the next two years, but with a concerted effort and systematic approach I managed to ever-so-slowly improve my situation to where I am today.I do volunteer work at least three hours per week for my local community house, I work two hours a week at a French bakery, and I also do several hours a week from home: volunteer PC hardware and software support for disadvantaged people, as well as being a full-time house-husband. Need I say I am also the main cook and housekeeper at home. My wife knows how lucky she is!I am very lucky to have a multi-disciplinary team looking after me comprising a general practitioner, gastroenterologist, dietician, psychologist, physiotherapist, and dentist. There have been several other professionals along the way who have dropped off the team once they were no longer adding value.I reached a plateau in my recovery process about a year ago. The surprising intervention that allowed me to move forward was referral to an incontinence clinic run by a physiotherapist (I referred myself after happening to read a brochure in a waiting room). I had some minor urinary incontinence problems (believe it or not an irritable bowel can set up an irritable bladder situation) but after the physio quickly resolved that issue she turned her attention to my IBS.What happened next was completely unexpected. I thought I knew everything there was to know about my IBS. She basically told me that she would need to teach me to poo properly again because I had been doing it wrong for a long time. As you can imagine I took some offense at this...after all I was 47 years old and had been a bit of a high flyer in the corporate world as well as being academically gifted.She has a special area set-up with a toilet, foot stool, and other aids. You keep your clothes on and pretend to go through the motions of producing a bowel motion. She checks your posture, breathing, abdominal muscle tension etc...I was very skeptical but agreed to play along.After several visits, lots of coaching, lots more 'homework' and perseverance I finally managed to relax enough to remove most of the fear, pain and trauma of going to the toilet and let my body go about its business without my interference. Of course, no prizes for guessing where all that fear had originated...IBS will not teach you to love your toilet!My visits to the toilet are a lot easier, take less time with less 'mopping up', a better 'emptying outcome' with less effort, therefore leading to fewer visits. My recurring hemorrhoids have faded away (hopefully never to visit again) and I no longer feel like I am the only male in the labor ward. As I continue to work on this aspect I hope that my new toilet behaviors will require less focus and will eventually become the second nature they should otherwise have been. Flow-on effects have been significant reductions in my medication regime.I hope that the above information will help someone to consider a perhaps unusual intervention that could remove yet another barrier to progress.",,toilet,home,intervention,physiotherapist,general practitioner,team,team,attitude,world,area

My parents constantly tell me to go back and see the doctor, but what can he do apart from change my medication?eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));My IBS is a lot better lately after I've cut out gas-producing foods such as baked beans and cabbage. I have also given up caffeine and alcohol, which is the worst when out with friends. I am currently considering having an allergy test done and having hypnotherapy, as I want my symptoms to be better before I start university in September. I tend to find that if you switch your mind and concentrate on breathing, the pain goes away quite quickly. I also make myself think that it will go away soon and that nothing bad is going to occur, and that if I do need to go to the toilet and be sick then that's what will happen and just let it be.I'd be more than happy to talk to anyone who wants to get in touch with me.E-mail Emma:[email protected]",,friend,people,pain,doctor,email,food,toilet,condition,exam,stomach
171,"This story is about my son who was a very healthy 13 year-old. His illness started two years ago. Right after boy scout camp Tommy started 
having severe stomach pains, diarrhea, vomiting a little blood and hot sweats. After four visits to the hospital and every test known to man Tommy was diagnosed with severe acid reflux, and was put on two Nexium a day.The Nexium seemed to help for three months, until the stomach pains and diarrhea came back - the only thing missing was the vomiting. Ninth grade began and Tommy was sick enough to miss school. The stomach doctor told us that Tommy now had two different diseases, acid reflux and IBS. After many trials with anti-spasmodic drugs and an anti-depressant, Tommy was sicker then ever. He lost over 20lbs and the medicines were making him sick. He was on seven pills a day, two Nexium, three Bentyl, one brewers' yeast and one anti-depressant.Tommy's stomach doctor suggested that we should get a second opinion. He basically left us in the dust because he could not help. I took Tommy off all  medicines, and he seemed to improve. We went to a Boston doctor who mentioned it might be a parasite. Tommy took a medicine called Alinia and it was like a miracle - the diarrhea seemed to stop, but the severe cramping was still there and nothing helped, until I discovered calcium and Beano.Tommy had sworn off milk two years ago because his first doctor thought he might be lactose intolerant. Tommy now takes two calcium a day with vitamin D and Beano. Beano has an enzyme that helps digest food and take away gas pains. Tommy is back to eating anything and everything again, and he has been good for almost two months and that's a long time for an IBS sufferer to feel well. I hope this helps someone, I saw the pain and suffering my son dealt with for two straight years.E-mail Tommy's Mom:[email protected]",,stomach,pain,drug,medicine,doctor,doctor,son,email,calcium,depressant
172,"I'm 17 years old, and the doctor has told me there is a 95% chance that I have IBS. I've had stomach problems for about four years and it's got worse as I've got older. I've been having tests for years. I've had blood test but they all came back negative. I've also been on a diet, no wheat or dairy which was hard! When I went food shopping I had to check on the backs of things to see if it had wheat or traces of dairy, I couldn't eat anything, well it felt like I couldn't. Then it got to the point where I didn't see the point in eating anymore and just got really depressed so my doctor thought it was best if I went back to normal and ate everything again.Everything I've tried, whether it's pills or food, works for about two or three months but then I just go back to feeling ill all the time. No-one seems to understand. My mum tries so hard to understand but it just upsets her to see her little girl so ill. I have no friends with IBS, they don't understand what I'm going through at all. I just need someone I can talk to about things and a person who can relate to my problems, to give me some advice! I'm trying so hard to not let it ruin my life but sometimes it just gets too hard to cope with. I still go out and go to parties but what I do (which I know isn't good for me) when I go to parties or up town, anything like that, is not eat at all until I get home, so I don't have to worry about getting a belly ache and  it ruining my night.Recently I've had a barium meal, where you have to swallow some liquid and it lights up your inside on an x-ray. The liquid made me so ill. All over Christmas I needed to go to the loo more often than usual and that was a lot, which I hated so much! In two weeks I'm going in to hospital to get the camera down my throat which I'm scared about but I'm being put to sleep for it so I can relax a bit, then I just have to wait on the results.

173,"I'm a 19-year old university student from the UK. For about three or four years I've had a 'dodgy' stomach and went to the doctors now and then just to be told to 'lose weight' or 'improve your diet', both of which I never tried to improve greatly. Around six months ago I was on holiday and got food poisoning, but when I still had these symptoms a few weeks on I went to the doctor who then diagnosed me with IBS.To start with when I heard this I cried and thought my life was over, and the doctor explained that there is no 'cure' but only ways to relieve symptoms. I suppose I'd always known that there wasn't something quite right with my body, but hearing it confirmed did upset me.But eventually I started researching IBS and realized how lucky I am, my case is only mild in comparison to what other people have to live with every day. I can still go out and socialize (even though there is a mild panic when I'm asked if I'm free).Since my doctors visit I've improved my diet, started exercising (although I could still improve this aspect!), and come to terms with IBS. Today my pains are nowhere near what they were six months ago and I feel healthier. I still got the pains and regular toilet visits, but I'm looking at ways I can improve all this. I'm considering the supplements others have taken and have worked for them, and constantly changing and altering my diet.Basically, I'm not going to let IBS depress me, I've got a whole life to live and I'm not going to live it thinking about my bowels every minute of the day.

I can't exactly remember when I started having symptoms, but I guess I knew that something wasn't quite right in that area for a while. I remember feeling tired and drained, and after visiting the doctor I had many blood tests to find out what the problem was. The results came back negative and I was told just to get on with things and if I noticed any other changes to come back.I remember at one appointment the doctor asked if I was having any issues with bowel movements etc. At the time I remember thinking something wasn't quite right, but I was too embarrassed to say.I think my first real symptom was having bad wind. Not nice! I live with three other friends at university (I'm from the UK by the way) and I could swear they could hear everything going on in the bathroom!After a while I noticed that I was getting bad pains in my stomach after eating, often so bad that I would have to lay curled up with a hot water bottle. I knew then that something definitely wasn't right, so I plucked up the courage and visited the doctor. After asking many questions, they diagnosed me with IBS. A lot of the things they asked hadn't even crossed my mind as being an IBS symptom. (I didn't really have any knowledge of it at the time).I realized then that the amount of times I visited the toilet wasn't normal. I don't have diarrhea or constipation as such, although occasionally I've had to make a run for the loo. I just feel like I need to 'go' when I don't. I guess this is constipation, but when this happens I have been previously during the day. My body generally seems to be a bit unpredictable!I've been on two types of tablets. At the moment I'm on peppermint oil, and I'm not sure if it's helping. I did stop taking it for a few days and I noticed a change for the worse in my bowel movements, so I guess it's doing something. I've also been cutting out certain foods. At the moment I've cut wheat right out of my diet, and it seems to have helped a great deal. I haven't had so much wind (which to me is the most embarrassing thing) and the stomach pains have gone.At the moment though the symptoms have flared up. I have the pains back and I feel the need to have a bowel movement, but only the tiniest stool will make its way out. So I don't know, maybe the diet isn't working. But I read on this site that the menstrual cycle can affect you, so maybe that's what's happening to me now? Who knows!All I know is that I have to live with it and keep trying new things. There seem to be people with IBS who are worse off than me, so I have to be grateful there.

So I thought straightaway no way can I sit on a coach for two days with no toilet, plus I wouldn't have used the coach toilet anyway, way too embarrassing!So I explained this to my doctor because I really wanted to go on this skiing trip, but it was getting me down that much I ended up breaking down in tears!

One IBS attack led to me having a panic attack and nearly falling down a flight of concrete stairs, but one of my very caring teachers caught me before I fell.

Mind you, there are tons of things included in this diet that I still can't eat (like red meat, nuts, eggs, any seasonings, certain fruits/vegetables...) but everyone is different. Now, my diet consists of just turkey, chicken, fruit (blueberries, grapes, apples, pears, cherries), vegetables (mushrooms, asparagus, carrots, artichokes), some oils, and dark chocolate.

My son is only 11 years old but he has suffered with this condition since birth. I have realized that it may not be very common but young children do suffer with this as well.It has been a real struggle trying to convince doctors that my son has IBS. I still don't have a diagnosis of IBS as my doctors seem to not want to believe that a boy can suffer with this. He has had all the medical tests but the doctors found nothing. But my son constantly complains of awful pains in his lower abdomen and he has a bloated stomach every day. He has a lot of trouble with constipation and often will go a week without being able to go. And then when he does it hurts him.He has now been referred to a dietician, but I await to see how effective this will be. As my son is starting secondary school in September I am now taking his treatment into my own hands. I've started to give him Senokot fiber sachets and I've switched him on to a Free From everything diet and it is working. He is going to the loo more often and his stools are slightly more to come out. He has only complained of the tummy pain once, just before he managed to use the loo for number two.I am very hopeful about this diet along with the extra fiber and lots of water. I'm not sure how this condition will develop with my son in the future. I truly hope it will gradually lessen to nothing at all, but for now I will be on the Free From aisle for all his dietary needs. It would be such a help if this food was not so expensive as well. My son didn't like the foods straightaway but it's what he has to eat so that he no longer has to have days off lessons. I know he will not be able to have the foods that he wants, which is probably a good thing anyway.I remember being a teenager and feeling as though I too may have had IBS. I would get a bloated feeling and have some tummy pains after certain foods like bread but I seemed to grow out of these symptoms. But I would like any parents who may have a child with this condition to just go with your parental instincts and take over the reins from the medical profession. He has only been on this diet for two weeks, but where my son would have some form of pain or nausea almost every day, he has only felt pain once.I've felt deeply sad at many times especially when it wasn't clear what was wrong with him.

The people I had to tell (mostly friends, when we were going out) were sympathetic, and seemed to understand. I also met a couple of other students who both had it.I had had severe agoraphobia before realizing what it was (the irritable bowel syndrome, I mean) and this didn't go away just because I knew. In fact, in some circumstances it got worse. I also suffered depression every time I had an attack. (This has now happened three times, and I'm hoping that I've finally got rid of it.)My irritable bowel is recurrent, and unpredictable - I never know what's going to happen next. I get the whole gamut of symptoms instead of just one recurring one. They all happen at all sorts of times.

He didn't seem to care about the problems I was having (he still doesn't) and insisted that I go out every night. I think he thought he was doing me a favor, but one night he wanted me to go to a nightclub. I hate them at the best of times, and I never go any more.Apart from few toilets, and the fact that I'm horribly shy, I can't dance and I can't stand up in a crowded room because of my balance. Anyway, he made me do all these things like learn stupid dances, on the grounds that 'I'd have more fun that way'. I didn't. By the time we were ready to go, I was so nervous I thought I was going to be sick.The evening didn't bring any accidents, but afterwards I spent most of the night in the toilet with violent diarrhea as a result of being so stressed. I had a lecture the next day, and I was exhausted, especially as he wanted me to stay until two in the morning.

I've never had a public accident (luckily), but I constantly worry about it. It's so wearing.Whenever I go anywhere that makes me even vaguely nervous, I always take two Imodium (regardless of symptoms), try to make sure I've been to the toilet before I go (if I can't go, I panic all the way to the nearest toilet) and wear a pad where possible to avoid embarrassment. It doesn't always help ease the panic, but sometimes I feel OK.Heat makes my IBS worse as well. I can work - all the work I've done so far has been when I've had IBS, but it means that for the past five years (two of them without knowing it) I've missed out on the ordinary teenage life.

My husband and I were lucky enough to have two healthy daughters.After these surgeries...I had pretty much found that I would have to live with the 'where's the bathroom?' and 'I have to run home for a little 
while!' Anyway, several years later, I found I had excruciating pelvic floor pain...which was relieved by going to the bathroom or getting rid of air. I finally had a hysterectomy and my OBGYN told me I had endometriosis as well. He told me after the surgery that I was cured!Well, I still have the pain on some days and some days I don't have any pain. I have determined after several years that this pain in associated with IBS. So far, I have always been able to find a restroom in time. Anyone who has this disorder knows the embarrassment this disorder can cause.Sometimes I wish the government that requires ramps for those in wheelchairs would require public buildings to have at least one private restroom for those of us with hidden handicaps. I don't have to tell the other sufferers about trying to work...it can be a real challenge.As for medications, I have found that Librax, Tylenol 3, Metronidazole (Flagyl) sure help. I also take two chewable tablets of Equalactin several times a day. This will help bulk up what you eat. I have also just found a new product on the shelves at Wal-Mart. The name is OmnigestEZ. I have only taken it for a few days, so I can't say for sure that this is going to be a success, but I was able to stay in my own bed last night and not have to move to a different room because of the amount of gas I experience at night.I also use a floor fan at night to help me sleep, so I don't have to wake up and listen to my insides rolling around, not to mention my husband being able to get a good night's sleep.My youngest daughter and I plan to leave for South America for ten days vacation. For this trip, I will make sure that I have all my meds, including Nullo tablets (they can be taken internally) to help with smell. I also buy several small spray bottles of Ease, Medi-Aire that can fit in my purse when I have to use a public restroom (these are a Godsend).I sure understand the down feelings all my fellow sufferers go through. It is not easy, but I just keep hoping that they are going to make great 
strides when it comes to understanding this disorder and hopefully new medications that will make life livable for us.",,toilet,pain,surgery,disorder,tablet,pill,tablet,medication,public building,husband
187,"I would like to tell you the beginning of my story, as that is where I am. I have to put up daily with the pain and uncomfortableness, I don't know from one day to the next if I will be needing to be near a toilet or if I can't go.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));My doctor diagnosed me about nine months ago. She was useless, gave me a leaflet and said 'Read this and try not to eat too much fat.' Well her being a doctor I listened to her 'advice'. The leaflet gave a little information - the usual eat more fiber, relax etc. My flat mate at the time suffered from IBS so she told me what she knew. I didn't realize that it's different for everyone. Anyhow I knew my IBS must've been set off by stress. I used to care about my job too much, and it made me stress out for the silliest things.To help with the stress and help me to relax I began going to a reflexologist. This was the most brilliant idea anyone ever gave me. It is the most heavenly feeling, and it helps to release toxins that can then be flushed out by drinking water (two liters daily). I still go once a month, to keep me calm.I have changed my diet, due to a book my boyfriend gave me (he has been a saint and found out more to help me than I have). I am currently trying the high fiber, although by reading everyone's stories it may make me worse! I am three days into this diet and it's not too bad, but I haven't noticed any major changes.I am still in the current job, which involves a lot of car journeys around the UK, I know where all the service stations are! I give less of a monkeys about it now, it doesn't stress me, and why should it? I am only paid for 37 hours a week, why should I spend many more hours worrying about it - and making myself ill? This attitude has been influenced by my partner who doesn't like bureaucratic companies, and it has helped me to detach my life from my job (we should work to live, not live to work!)The latest thing he has done for me is introduce aromatherapy. He bought me an oil burner and three oils for Christmas. He also spent well over an hour in the shop discussing IBS, stress, hormones etc with the aromatherapist. I was very skeptical about aromatherapy, I always have been (how can lavender be relaxing to someone if they've never smelt it before? Surely their brain just wouldn't recognize it?)Well for the last two weeks we have put six drops of lavender into boiling water in the burner (the burner needs to hold at least 40ml of liquid). Lavender helps you to relax, so for three hours before bed burning it in the same room as you helps you to sleep deeply, thus helping your insides to 'recover' better from the day. I have to say it has helped, and is something I will continue with.I am very lucky to have such a great partner, and now to have found the UK IBS Network. I know now I'm not suffering alone. I am annoyed at myself for making it worse by stressing about work - especially as it's not a job that I wanted to do, but had to take due to the need to pay the rent.",,job,bonfire,burner,doctor,doctor,oil,stress,diet,oil,tale

terrifying panic attack whilst I was recovering. Both my parents died unexpectedly around this time and the doctor said it was all just stress and 
grief combined.However, I then began to get very anxious about everything, I felt like I couldn't breathe, my throat was constricted and I had excruciating stomach cramps. Many times over the following weeks I went to casualty, convinced I was dying! Most of the doctors were sympathetic if uninformative. I was given pessaries in case it was appendicitis, ECG tests for heart disease and numerous blood tests. Nothing could be found so I was referred to a consultant.They then performed a gastroscopy (camera down throat) and found I had a small hiatus hernia, and a barium x-ray but the tests were clear 
(neither test was actually that bad, just in case you happen to be referred for one, they sound worse than they are!). I was also ultrasound scanned internally and externally, and a gallstone was discovered. Although they wanted to remove my gallbladder they were reluctant to because I weigh over 17 stone and I wasn't keen either!After all this, stretching over a year or two, they diagnosed me with IBS...I am currently trying hard to lose weight on a low fat, sensible calorie healthy eating plan and really hope it will help. I do suffer from the usual bowel problems, sometimes I go five times a day, sometimes not for three days.

I am cutting out caffeine and drinking peppermint and chamomile teas and that seems to help, touch wood, and losing weight will help me personally.Also having a wonderful boyfriend who is supportive helps too but I don't know if this will ever go away, if I can just learn to live with it and not be scared all the time I think I'll cope!

The terrible wind and rumbling noises seemed ten times worse when sat in a silent room with 50 people sitting exams for sometimes three hours at a time. After the first experience I thought it was just an upset stomach and once I'd been to the toilet I'd be all right. I'm still here and still suffering.I found your website the other day at a time when I was feeling particularly low. I am about to start a new job and of course the main task of my first day will be to locate all the ladies toilets. Some of the stories I have read on your site have made me realize that my symptoms (alternating diarrhea/constipation/spasms/wind/pain) are not as bad as some people's.But one thing I find difficult to live with (and this is getting worse, not better) is the fear of an attack happening even if I start the day feeling OK.After the problems didn't go away once my exams had finished, my last few months at school were terrible. I used to starve myself some days thinking if I didn't eat anything I wouldn't need to go to the toilet. But of course it doesn't work that way. I left school and once out of the restricted classroom scenarios I thought I would be okay. But my parents insisted I went to college and that meant two more years ahead of me.I didn't spend too much time studying whilst at college - I spent every day and night worrying about what would happen if I had an attack. I hated sitting in the classrooms or lecture theaters with people close to me and spent many an hour with my legs crossed worrying over the rumbling noises my stomach made and trying to deal with the constant need to pass wind.I couldn't tell anyone what I was going through. I just find it very difficult to talk about, embarrassing most of all. I failed most of my exams 
at college and told my parents that I wasn't interested in uni. They were disappointed but there was no way I could put myself through the stress of another three or four years of sitting in classrooms and sitting in exams. I need to be able to go the loo when I want and not just because it's break time!So I started work and with the stress of having to sit in classrooms all day gone I thought I would be okay...how wrong I was.I enjoy working and socializing with people at work but the worry of my IBS is very depressing. I suffer from claustrophobia (as a result I think of feeling trapped in the classrooms as a teenager) and now, when a manager asks for a private word about something and wants to go in a meeting room, I have a panic attack.I walk into managers' offices/meeting rooms and my heart is beating so rapidly and hard against my chest I feel sometimes it will explode. The fear of being in a room with someone/some people where I can't just get up and leave if I need to, is ruining my life.The constant worry is on a par with the symptoms of my IBS and sometimes I think I'm going mad. Sometimes I look back to when it started and think to myself, if I knew 14 years ago that I'd still be suffering now, would I still be here? I have recently been made redundant and have had to sit through several interviews in order to get another job. One interview was at 2pm and after getting up at 8am and eating only one piece of toast I was in and out of the bathroom all morning.Stress is definitely the main factor in my irritable bowel syndrome but it is a vicious circle. I panic if I have to attend a meeting or go somewhere where I won't be able to go to the toilet right away if I need to, and this panic brings on my IBS. So I try and relax and not panic and eat all the things I'm supposed to and stay away from the things I'm not and then sometimes I feel quite alright and I'll go into the meeting... and then have an attack. You can't win.I am sick of feeling sick with worry and often have to remind myself of the good things in life. I have a wonderful fiance who knows about my problems but, as with a lot of non-sufferers, he thinks if I just forget about it and don't worry about it, it won't happen.I have only ever told one other person about my IBS - my boss from the job I just left. She was very understanding but the only reason I told her was because I am leaving and don't have to face her again. There was one final meeting she wanted me to attend and I was suffering badly that day and just told her I couldn't go to the meeting and why.I now wonder if I should have told her earlier and perhaps I should be more open about it in my new job? Would it make a difference or will I just feel even more self-conscious of people counting how many times I go the toilet each day?As for doctors, I am still working up the courage to go and see one. You might find that crazy after so many years of suffering but I am so mortified and embarrassed by it that the only way I can discuss it is in writing.Thanks for putting this site on the web and thanks to the other sufferers who have shared their story.

201,"My IBS began in my early teens. I was prone to getting throat infections and every time my doctor would prescribe antibiotics (this may just be a coincidence but it's the only thing I can attribute to the onset of my symptoms other than puberty). After taking the courses of antibiotics I began to urgently need the toilet on a regular basis (oddly this usually occurred mostly on Monday mornings - maybe worsened by the stress of going to school?).eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));This progressed and after a while the school complained that I was missing too much time. I was sent to a specialist who prodded and poked my stomach, asked me questions then declared I had IBS and told me to up my fiber intake.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I've now had irritable bowel syndrome (if that's what it really is) for 20 years. I've tried just about everything I can think of and nothing really 
seems to help. For years I lived on kaolin and morphine (which I'd take as soon as my stomach gave its first warning symptom) but I've gradually 
reduced this and now take it rarely.Over the years my symptoms have changed slightly in format/intensity, but I think this is because I know what to expect and try not to get so stressed when it happens now. I seem to get most (but not all) attacks in the morning. I can get up feeling fine and usually have up to about an hour when I'm OK.Then, quite often just as I'm about to go out the door to work, I'll need the toilet. So I go, and it's OK, not much pain just urgency but I know it will get worse. I continue to try and get to work but within five minutes I need to go again! This time I get the lower back and front ache, aching upper arms, and progressively looser bowel movements, often with a lot of wind and later on mucus.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I also get what I feel is like an adrenaline rush through my body (which in the past has caused me to get worried so much so that I tremble/shake - I just let things happen now and this has helped lessen it). At this point I know there's no point trying to do anything until it clears up (this normally takes a couple of hours). If I get off the toilet during this time I know that within 10 to 15 minutes I'll be back.Moving around definitely brings the symptoms on faster than sitting/lying down. This can be useful if you can put up with it, as it enables me to get through an IBS episode quicker and get on with my work and social commitments. Eventually my bowel movements lessen in quantity and the main symptoms subside, but I'm always left feeling washed out and if I can I often sleep for an hour or so.I know when an attack is coming to the end because my stomach starts to grumble hungrily. I usually stick to sips of water during and just after an attack which seems to help the queasiness a little.Interestingly, I often get attacks when I'm supermarket shopping (some supermarkets cause it more than others). The only thing I can relate it to is the smell of some of the products (which becomes more intense/annoying just before an attack). I do get migraines as well and a heightened sense of smell is often an indicator that I'm about to get an attack, so this could well be linked.As for dealing with the pain/aches, I find the best thing is distraction. I use a combination of breathing exercises, rub my outer thighs with my hands and recite (in my head) the lyrics from a song (some work better than others!) This may seem ridiculous but it does seem to work.The worst thing about IBS for me (apart from the symptoms) is the inconvenience and thought of letting people down. It's very difficult to 
explain to people at a meeting (work or otherwise) that the reason you're late is because you've been stuck on the toilet for several hours!I can't say I've come to terms with my IBS even after 20 years, but I'm slowly learning to live with it and live in the constant hope that I will find a cure eventually! Good luck to you all, no matter how bad it gets try not to let it get you down (or it wins).PS: I've tried fiber, Colpermin and other antispasmodics, antidepressants, sugar-free and fat-free diets etc....none seem to work. I'm convinced that something changed the way my gut reacts to food and until that is reversed or I can retrain my gut I will still get IBS.I'm currently three weeks into a no added sugar or sweeteners, low fat, no processed food eating regime. I feel healthier but still get regular IBS (it's quite bad at the moment but I'm sticking with the altered diet to see if it gets better over time - after 25 years of sweetened, fatty, chemical-laden processed foods I reckon it will take a while for my gut to realize I've stopped trying to poison it!).PPS: If you haven't given up sugar yet then do. It provides no nutritional benefit to the body as it so pure and actually robs the body of vitamins and minerals so that it can be processed to be stored as fat. Next time you go to the supermarket look at all the food labels. Manufacturers put sugar in everything! You body doesn't need or want it. There is enough naturally occurring sugar in natural foods.If you don't believe me check out the internet for the true story about sugar! (Warning - coming off sugar is not easy but well worth it, your body and your dentist will thank you!).

203,"I am a 22-year-old female and I have suffered from constant right-sided bowel pain for about four years. It became more severe 
about a year and a half ago. I went to a gyno thinking that it was ovary related. I had a laparoscopy which uncovered minimal endometriosis. I 
thought I was cured. No such luck, the pain continued. I do occasionally suffer from constipation and diarrhea but this I can live with. I do get 
very bloated, particularly at night. Sometimes I look about four months pregnant!My doctor recommended taking a fiber supplement. The first day I took the full dose I woke up in the middle of the night in intense pain. I was screaming. My mum took me to the after hours center where the doctor gave me Buscopan, no result, and Pethidine, and still nothing. I have never experienced pain like that ever! It was so intense.So the doctor called an ambulance which took me to the hospital, where I was dosed on more Pethidine. Eventually they put in a rectal tube and blew my intestines full of air which relieved the pain.I saw a specialist. Thought I might have Carcinoid Syndrome, a sort of tumour. I was terrified, thinking I was going to die. But tests and a 
colonoscopy revealed nothing. IBS was what the doctor thought. So I am now on amitriptyline and have been for a year. It does help the daily pain. But I still get pain around my periods and other times for no particular reason. If I forget to take it I am in pain again the next day.Don't get me wrong, it's great to have something to relieve the pain. With that constant crampy pain all day I couldn't even work. But I do not want to take an antidepressant for the rest of my life!

204,"I am 22 and work for a major airline (not a flight attendant). I was recently diagnosed with IBS and an ulcer... along with a few other things (I am falling apart at a young age, I guess). I was at work and started getting the tell-tale cramping and my stomach started to gurgle. Of course on my way to the bathroom I didn't make it.So here I am on an airplane in the hangar, totally a mess! I cleaned up as best as I could and had to tie a coat around my waist and walk past all the mechanics and everyone on my team and drive to the break room. To make matters worse, our company parking lot is a ten-minute bus ride away from the airport. That has to be the worst.I am too ashamed to tell anyone what has been happening to me. I have taken almost two weeks off from work (here and there) in the last 
month to try and cope with this. All night I wonder if it is going to happen again. Every little noise my stomach makes or every little cramp I get I 
wonder if this is 'IT' again. My parents and my boyfriend think that this is all due to my other medical problems and I don't have the courage to tell them.At work we all joke about what would happen if... and I take offense to it, even though they don't know that I have been in that situation many times. I don't like to go out because I get nervous and need to know where the bathroom is... but you all know that.I am planning to go back to college for my second degree pretty soon and I am afraid that that will just be another place for me to embarrass myself. I like to be home because I don't worry so much about it, which I am sure makes it 'better'.I am determined to find something to fix this because I don't want it to take over my life.

205,"My IBS symptoms started when I was six years old. I was sitting at my desk one day and needed to go really bad, by the time I got to the bathroom I found out I already did! I stuffed toilet paper in my pants and told the teacher I had a stomach ache so I could go home early.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));The elementary school I went to had teachers who, for some cruel reason or another, would not dismiss children to the bathroom (some 
kids ended up peeing in their pants!) and when you could finally convince the teacher you really weren't lying, if you were in the toilet too long 
they'd get really mad and threaten the kids! I wish I could've sued the school!eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));The symptoms got worse as I got older. No one believed me. My sister would bang on the bathroom door if she couldn't get 'ready for bed on time' cause she was anal about going to sleep on time, getting to school on time, (basically an on time maniac, that IBS people would do better to not be around). She did this every time I had a bowel movement!She'd scream and cry and beat on the door, and no one stopped her, nor did she care about my pain. She was such a selfish little brat! (Side note: To this day she is still a bully, though not to me. Thank God she moved out! That was a blessing! Though she's married; and her husband is getting the same treatment she gave me.)eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));It was her annoying threats from the other side of the door that have made me even more uncomfortable on the toilet to this day! I cope by using loud fans (so I can't hear anyone else in the house). I've gotten so paranoid that I feel like just screaming, and killing the next person who makes even a pin drop outside the door.The only time I had friends was in eighth grade and at a camp I went to last year (noted as the only camp I've ever gone to because of the pain). I've remained friendless for the good amount of my non-existent life and never had a boyfriend. I always felt so guilty for 'letting people down' when they asked me to go places with them. That I would write letters, and give them reasons to hate me so I could just not feel like a useless friend.I know if anything happened to anyone I could never be there for them, because it's so hard for me to have the courage to leave the house. I'm paranoid about where the toilet is, always!I've tried to commit suicide many times, but in my most insane moments I felt like I was just such an awful evil person that I needed to be punished by staying alive. I figured God was out to get me, because He didn't understand my pain.What is ironic is that many years later I prayed to Him for help and relief from the pain; those are the only days I'm able to leave the house! I've mastered the prayer thing, when I don't pray, I don't get to go anywhere, but when I pray I can make it out of the house (even though I go to public restrooms).I've tried throwing myself out of a window (my parents pulled me back in), cutting my wrists, holding my breath (that one almost never worked) even praying to God to kill me. Just this April I was taken to a psychiatric ward for one of my 'episodes'. I've had severe depression as far back as I can remember. But I was desperate and wanted medication, to hell whether I would break out from an allergy to it or not.In the end the psychiatrist sent me home empty-handed, but for the first time in my life somebody actually understood all of the symptoms and knew I needed therapy and treatment. But she was a night doctor and I never saw her again, because she only comes to that ward once a month! So I was alone in coping again with no-one to turn to.I've never taken doctor prescribed medicines (I'm allergic to all drugs; yes even simple Tylenol!) Most days I just feel like a truck hit my body (I have fibromyalgia; another disease that doctors don't believe exists), and I dread morning, because it means sitting at least a couple of hours on the toilet at a time (having to go really bad, but not producing anything, sometimes my legs fall asleep), and then if I'm lucky enough to leave the house (it never fails: I always go when I'm in a public place!)eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I always have trouble going, but once it comes out, it's so soft I wonder why it didn't fall out easier. Plus I always have to put my feet up on something, to get better leverage to push the rest out, because it never finishes on its own. I always take soft towel wipes with me in my purse, so I can wipe easier and not get a chapped butt.Before I leave the house I always get panic attacks with severe cramps and sweating. When I was taking a singing class in college I had such a bad cramp I couldn't breathe. I was delirious and beyond the ability to think or see straight, I never fainted though. I crawled to the car on my hands and knees, crying and doing lamaze breathing exercises.My dad drove me to the hospital (since I was incapable of doing anything except clutching tightly anything within my reach and crying loudly in pain). A nurse wheeled me in, and since they thought I wasn't important enough for them to see right away, made me wait an hour!They finally x-rayed my abdomen, told me I was full of poop and to take a laxative! I could have killed that woman, but she was obviously one of the perfect people on this planet! I've had many episodes that come close to that, but that one was the worse one I had. The only other one that comes that close in pain was when I got food poisoning in Reno. All night long I was throwing up and had diarrhea. I was exhausted, and by morning I was still at it, hoping I wouldn't poop while I was throwing up, and vice versa!As we left the motel my dad held me up by one arm, and I was literally walking like a chimpanzee with my knuckles to the ground (with my free hand) out of the lobby (we had to check out that day). My parents gave me lots of gingerade tea (which didn't help) and packed me in between the car seat and a huge garbage bag of ice (that always helps with cramping, for me). The motion of the car made me sick, but by the time we got to the Nut Tree my body felt great but I was worn out.You know my IBS is so bad now (I eat great, so it isn't my diet) that even water makes me have to go! It totally sucks! I've never been able to keep a job, the longest I've had a job was three months.I fall into depressions easily and wonder what will happen to me if my parents die, since I have no money, no job, no friends, no family except them, and no insurance.

206,"I don't know if this is exactly what I have, even though I had a doctor or two tell me that is probably what I have. But I never had 
diarrhea until I had my gallbladder removed back in 1985, and I have had it ever since. I went to the surgeon, who sent me to a gastroenterologist, and he ran tests, telling me that he could find nothing wrong with me.I have tried prescription medicines, over the counter medicines, and nothing works. The only thing I have found that does work, without a doubt, is something that really isn't good for you and that is Mini Thins! Something within those pills stop my diarrhea.I can eat a meal and I know, like clockwork, within 20-30 minutes I better be near a bathroom because I am going to have diarrhea, bad, and it is uncontrollable. If I don't get on the toilet exactly when I need to, it is in my clothes, which is totally embarrassing and irritating. I am sick of it. After all these years I know there are some things that will trigger diarrhea if I have one too many, like cups of coffee, etc...so I stay away 
from that, with exception to maybe one cup ever so often.It can hit at anytime, but is mainly due after I eat the first time each day, a lot of times the second meal too, and I will have diarrhea until I am 
just totally drained, it will come out like water at times. There is no trying to control it, or to squinch-up, as I say, to keep it from coming. It comes and there is just no control over it.The only thing that stops it, I go to the store and buy one or two packages of the Mini Thins and within no time, it stops. Sometimes it will happen three or four days in a row, sometimes it may skip two to three days, with maybe only one slight case of diarrhea during that time.I have talked to several people who have had gallbladder surgery and some did not get this, but the majority of people I spoke to did start to have diarrhea after gallbladder surgery, and a few had been going through it for 15-20 years. That was back when I had only been dealing with it for maybe a year or two. Now it has been about 18 years for me and I still have it. I hate it!After my surgery in 1985, there were times that I was afraid, literally, to leave my home and go anywhere because the diarrhea could hit me at anytime and if I did manage to go anywhere I never could enjoy eating, or eating out, because it would strike me. This went on at least the first six to seven months after surgery until I figured out that some things would trigger it more than others, so at least I had a little control there.Now this may not be called IBS to you, or to anyone else, but this is what a doctor has told me years ago. I don't know what else it could be, to be honest!

207,"I hate the idea that anyone has to live with IBS, but I was so glad to find this website and to know that I wasn't all alone. About eight years 
ago, I had a bout of constipation that lasted about two weeks. My stomach swelled up to look like I was about 6-7 months pregnant. No medicines seemed to help. Finally it was over.After that, I thought everything was OK. Then about three months later, I got a really bad case of diarrhea that lasted about a week. Then I was constipated again, back and forth. It has been this way since then. Mine is usually diarrhea for about a week then I will be constipated for a few days. One is no better than the other.Diarrhea so bad that I get migraine headaches and throwing up. Constipation so bad that it feels like it will rip my intestines out. I have 
plenty of embarrassing tales. I no longer eat out in restaurants and I don't eat for several hours before I have to go to the grocery store or any place in public. I never go places if I don't know if they have a restroom or where it is.I always have a plan...I always know where the closest restroom is and the closest way to get there. My doctor's office is two hours away from where I live. I make my appointment for early in the morning and I don't eat till after I get home. Still I know where every rest stop and convenience store is en route.I was diagnosed with IBS, hypothyroidism and fibromyalgia. The pain from the fibromyalgia is bad enough alone but add a bout of constipation or diarrhea with it and it is pure torture. I kept thinking that as much as I have diarrhea that I should be losing weight, but my thyroid problems were keeping me from losing.I love food, and I love to cook. It nearly kills me, not to be able to eat the things that I love so much. But I hate the consequences when I do 
break down and have them. I quit my job a year ago, because I couldn't get up and run to the restroom whenever I needed to. I had been in a bind to many times.I understand about no-one understanding the symptoms. It's hard to even tell anyone what's going on inside your body, sometimes I can't even believe it.

The pains are so bad I sometimes will come close to vomiting, I sweat and feel so weak some days. The Lomotil that my doctor gave me gives me some relief, and I'm able to have some peace for at least a few hours out of the day, I find that I can't go even one day without taking Lomotil at least twice.This has really affected my life, I can't make plans at the last minute to go anywhere unless I know a toilet will be nearby, and even if I go out for only a short errand without taking my Lomotil, I find myself in trouble with the cramping and always dread an accident.I also often run daily low-grade fevers and feel exhausted a lot of the time.

I stumbled upon this site for the first time tonight and I am absolutely amazed at the sheer volume of us who are living with this condition. I have lived with the pain from this condition for 13 years and I had no idea that so many people were suffering from the exact same symptoms and intense pain as I do. I had always felt like I must be the only one in the world who lives in this kind of misery.After 13 years I have tried everything. Three years ago I gave birth to twins, and I can honestly say that there are some days where the pain from IBS is worse than the pain from having my children.My IBS has gotten so bad in just this last year that I have lost 45 pounds because I am just in so much pain I can't eat and I now also suffer from horrible panic attacks. But I came to a breaking point last November on my 23rd birthday.I was feeling horrible as usual, but I had not left the house in a month and I needed to buy some things for my kids. So I just tried to 'suck it up' and my husband and I went to Wal-Mart. After being there for only 10 minutes, I began to feel 'the pain', which in turn led to a panic attack. I went to sit in the car as my husband paid for our items and when he came out I could hardly breathe.The more pain I had, the worse it made the panic attack, and then the stress from the panic attack made my stomach pain worse. It was a circle that landed me in the ER that night. I decided I couldn't live like that anymore. My IBS pain had ruined some of the best days in my life. It controlled how I lived every moment my life. But after that day in the ER last November, I decided to take control back. I have finally found four things that help to control some of my pain.First - I only drink water now. No soda, no Gatorade, no coffee, etc. This has helped tons! People with IBS focus mostly on what we eat, but what we drink can be just as important.Second - I don't eat anything with artificial sweeteners in it. You would be amazed at how many people have digestive problems because of artificial sweeteners in foods and drinks and don't even know that's what's causing it.Third - I don't eat any fast food at all. If I even touch any fast food I'm sick for three days.Fourth - painkillers. Yep, good old Tylenol, Advil, ibuprofen, etc. A lot of people never think to take them for IBS. I didn't for 13 years! Then one day I had PMS cramps while I had an IBS tummy ache and I took some Aleve for the cramps. Well 15 minutes later I had realized that it had relieved the pain from both. I have found that for me, Aleve works better then Tylenol. It still amazes me to this day that I never thought to take painkillers for this pain.I still have to watch what foods I eat and I still have pain some days. But I don't have pain as often, I don't have panic attacks any more, I don't feel nauseous all the time, and I don't feel tired all the time. I have been able to get so much of my life back by doing those four things in the past few months.E-mail Angela:[email protected]",,pain,attack,attack,attack,attack,fast food,people,condition,email,cramp
212,"I began having symptoms of IBS (diarrhea type) in my 20s. We were told that our community well was contaminated with giardia which may have started it off. Over the next many years I became allergic to many foods, and eventually got down to only two that wouldn't cause internal hives and diarrhea. I tried different medications and had reactions to all of them, too, including prednisone, so I kept trying to find my own answers.I had studied nutrition and biochemistry in college, so I had some background in the field. I began reading scientific articles and tried to sort out anything that might give me clues. I did find out that I have abnormally high levels of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). I spoke with a researcher to see if he could give me any leads to possible natural treatments. He suggested a form of lithium which I tried in very small doses but had too many side effects. But I felt that I was on the right track and kept looking.I had read that a cofactor in the production of PGE1 is zinc. I theorized that if I could get my zinc levels down maybe it would help. I finally found some information on an amino acid called histidine which has an affinity for many metals including mercury, nickel, iron, calcium and zinc. I started taking it and within just a week the diarrhea had disappeared for the first time in almost 20 years and I could eat almost anything with no reaction. It was just amazing.I experimented for several months with the dosage and found that I did best with about 250mg per day along with 15mg of zinc to be sure I didn't get depleted in zinc - if you chelate out too much zinc your nose will get stuffy. (Also too little zinc affects histamine release which will in turn diminish sexual response.) If I took a slightly higher dosage I could even experience what it was like to be constipated for the first time in ages!Because histidine both transports and chelates out zinc, it seems to be very effective in moderating high prostaglandin levels that cause over-contraction of the smooth muscle and excess cytokine production in the intestines. I have been using it for 10 years now with great success. The only time I experience the IBS symptoms is if I quit taking the histidine for a week or so and eat a food that used to cause allergic reactions.I read through the stories on the site, and it brought back so many memories of embarrassing situations. It's wonderful to be free of the symptoms...no extra changes of clothes, no fear of going to a football game! A nice side effect was my headaches that had plagued me for years also disappeared.I am a nutritional consultant and have recommended this treatment for several of my clients. One lady with IBS was able to get off all her medications for the first time in years and take a vacation to Mexico. It may not work for everyone, but it's an inexpensive experiment and worth a try. The brands I recommend are Tyson, Montiff or Jo-Mar.Hope this is helpful to someone, and to all of you, I wish you success in finding relief and a better quality of life.E-mail Jan:[email protected]",,zinc,side effect,quality of life,amino acid,email,success,production,treatment,allergic,medication

As a kid and through the years I think I had spells of it but never went to a doctor for it.Anyway, I mostly have upper pain in the chest area. Sometimes around the belly button. I have given up most everything that would contribute to IBS without fail, though it comes back. No rhyme nor reason to it. I'll have pain when I go to the bathroom but briefly. Sometimes hard with hard pain and sometimes soft and water with relief afterwards.I take Nexium and I have tried Librax and I have tried peppermint oil caps and I have tried Lexapro pills. If I do all at the same time I get relief but I do not want to be held down toprescribed tranquilizersfor certain forever.

215,"My IBS story starts when I was very young (way before the 5th grade). I had very bad bouts of constipation. It usually consisted of me sitting on the toilet, crying, while my mom gave me castor oil and hot tea. I also remember my mom giving me a couple of enemas to boot. After that (around the 5th grade) I ended up in the hospital for abdominal pain. They ran a whole bunch of test and said that they couldn't find anything. So they ended up diagnosing me with gastritis. I don't even know what that is.I'm now 28 years old and am still having problems. I had lots of problems with diarrhea when I hit my early 20s. I thought that it was just from what I was eating. So I started changing the way I was eating but the diarrhea never stopped. My family noticed it but nobody (not even myself) thought that it was anything serious.After I moved to Kentucky, that's when things got really bad. Abdominal pain and cramping, chronic diarrhea...I thought I was dying. Still never went to the doctors or the hospital because all I kept remembering is that when I was younger they couldn't find anything wrong.This year has been pure hell. I'd have diarrhea for a week and then two days of constipation. Finally decided to see my doctor last Saturday after doing research on IBS and lo and behold he agreed with me. Gave me a prescription and told me to watch my milk and cheese intake...I don't even drink that much milk...whatever.Last night was the roughest so far. I've had constipation for the past five days. My sister told me I looked like I was six months pregnant, my stomach hard as a rock. So she told me that she might have to take me to the hospital for an enema. Later she gives me this nasty concoction she made (she said it was warm tea with ginger)...gag...it was disgusting. Didn't loosen anything up either. So I came home this morning and did what I had to do...took laxatives.There has got to be a better way to control this. I don't think I can continue to live like this. It's like there's no hope or cure for it so the 
doctor's will just keep throwing meds at us until something works. I feel like such a guinea pig. If anyone has any tips for treating constipation (besides laxatives) please email me.E-mail Anna:[email protected]",,constipation,doctor,doctor,email,pain,tea,mother,agree,tale,pig
216,"I was first diagnosed with IBS when I was 21 years old. In the year 2002 I got pregnant with my first child...we were expecting a baby boy. Just two weeks before my due date our son died in utero. It was the most awful thing that has ever happened to us. I became very depressed and started to experience cramps and diarrhea.I thought that I was getting the flu until it lasted about a month non-stop. I couldn't go anywhere. I was too afraid to leave the house! My family kept telling me that it was stress due to loss of our child, but I really didn't believe them being as stubborn as I am. I finally broke down and saw a 'butt' doctor. I had acolonoscopyand the results were disappointing....there was nothing wrong with me! It was all in my head! [Editor's note - just because a colonoscopy shows no results does not mean that there is nothing wrong with you - and it certainly doesn't mean it's in your head.] Those of you who have IBS with diarrhea know what I mean. You almost wish something was wrong with you so can be cured.I was put on Zoloft 100mg for my depression and it was supposed to help with my stress levels. I am now going to be 23 years old and have been on Zoloft for two years. I think it has helped somewhat with my stomach problems.To this day I still get bad urges to use the restroom. I have to plan my daily events around the toilet and it's depressing. Sometimes I will wake up at thee o'clock in the morning with flu-like symptoms. What really gets to me is me and my husband tried to have another baby and in February 2004 we had a healthy baby boy...anyway, sometimes while I'm feeding him a bottle I have to put him down so I can explode on the toilet! I feel so bad when I have to put him down four times in a row during a bottle.I hate using public restrooms but now I have learned to love them...I was kind of forced upon that. I think having another baby has helped a lot with my stomach problems...I know that may sound strange but getting pregnant kind of helped. My bowel movements still range from diarrhea to loose or soft stools, even with the soft stools I have to rush to the restroom...once I feel the urge there is no stopping it.I'm so glad that I found this website.

For the past 15 years (right after a three-month dose of Dioxicilan to treat Lyme disease) IBS struck with a fury.

I really did think I was losing my mind.When we went in stores I always wanted to use the bathroom (to be safe) and my then husband would get very annoyed at me and would complain he always had to wait around while I wasted time on the throne.

I though there was something seriously wrong with me, not that this isn't serious, but something really serious. I have searched the internet for hours trying to find out what is wrong with me. I am convinced I have IBS.I have been too scared to go to a doctor, because I though they were going to tell me I was dying. I think everyone's stories may have given me the courage to finally go seek help, although by the sounds of it it may not help. I am 26 years old, and always thought my chronic diarrhea was from my diet. I eat like crap, but recently it has been getting worse.I have been feeling so sick for the past few years. I had my gallbladder removed when I was 19, and ever since then I have been suffering from really bad diarrhea and stomach cramps, and now lately I have had the pleasure of feeling nauseated every single morning, and no I'm not pregnant.I always thought it was because of my period, or once again my diet. I have tried to eliminate 'trigger' foods, but that doesn't seem to help either. After reading these stories, I realize that my symptoms are not as severe as some, but still a huge pain in the butt. I can't plan anything ahead of time for fear that my stomach might be a little b***h that day.It really sucks, because I feel like my life is passing me by. I try not to let it get the best of me, but some days I just cry and cry. My sweet fiance is very understanding, but he doesn't really understand how bad it gets sometimes. And I am too embarrassed to tell him about it completely. I tell him I'm not feeling well and just leave it at that. It has started to get in the way of our sex life. I haven't had any accidents yet, but am terrified that it may happen.I am convinced that I will find something that will work for me. I used to be such a happy person, and now feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I know this is not true, but I can't help it sometimes. I was actually at Walgreens last night, and found some medicine that is supposed to actually help relieve IBS symptoms, it actually has IBS in the name and I just started them this morning. So time will tell. I really hope they work.I really miss being able to go out with my friends, and not have to worry about finding the bathroom. I really have a hard time going in public 
places, but have found that sometimes you just can't help it. I was out with my sister-in-law over the weekend looking at model town homes that she's thinking of buying. I usually carry some Imodium or take it before going out, but that day I was feeling great. No symptoms to speak of, and all of a sudden my belly starts rumbling and cramping and I'm thinking please no.My sister in law is busy talking to the realtors and I'm thinking to myself we have to go now. So I decide to wonder through the house, and see if I can secretly use a bathroom, there are three. And to my horror, none of them are even usable. So I start the breathing exercises and tell myself it will be OK. I start sweating and shaking and finally tell her we have to go. I'm not feeling well.So I tell her I have to pee really bad, and we need to stop at a gas station. To my absolute horror once again, she missed the turn for the first one, and we had to wait for 10 miles for the next one, with lots of stop lights in between. Thank God I made it, but it was really close. And I felt so sick and scared, I just cried. When I finally came out, she was like feeling better? And all I could do was mumble there was a long line.Why am I so embarrassed to talk about this problem? I realize now that it is a widespread problem, and affects far more people than I realized. But it is a personal thing, and I have a hard time telling people sometimes I have problems controlling my bowels.Anyway, it helps so much to know that I am not the only person in the world suffering from this terrible illness. I hope someday there will be some answers for us. I really hope this new medicine works for me, or at least even controls it somewhat.Please feel free to e-mail me. I am feeling really lonely, as people have stopped asking me out, because I rarely go anymore or end up cancelling at the last minute.

I also am suffering from depression and panic attacks because of IBS. I am 22 years old and married for three years with a beautiful daughter.I'm sick of the constant pain, the washed-out feeling, the weakness, the fact that it makes me feel disgusting and depressed. I have lost my job as a medical assistant because of my illness. I was always showing up late, having accidents on the way to work and having to go home, clean up and change. As a grown woman I never thought I'd have an accident on myself. I think when that started to happen, is when I knew I had hit the bottom, and I was disgusted with myself. My boss, a doctor, told me I should take a leave of absence. Well over a year later I'm still absent.My relationship with my husband is suffering because of me. We do not make love like we used to. In the middle of it I have to go to the bathroom, or I'm in too much pain to even do it. Not to mention how very sexy I feel when I have diarrhea all day and my ass is just on fire, and sore as can be. And I think...how can he want to have sex with me? How does he think I'm attractive?I cannot play with my daughter like I used to be able to. We'd go swimming and shopping on little vacations. I'd play with her, go on bike rides and to the zoo. Not anymore and that just kills me. I don't want to just sit by and watch her grow up, I want to be a part of it, make the memories with her so she can say when she grows up, 'Mom, remember when we did this' and not 'Remember when I did this'.My life has totally been turned upside down. My husband and I went from two incomes down to one, and of course the medical expenses are always rising. I used to love to shop and go out to dinner and to the bars with my girl friends and/or husband, but now I can't do that because we have to save money to pay for all my medical bills and prescriptions.About prescriptions - I think I have been on every single possible pill that they have made and are experimenting with. From Lotronex, which has been taken off the market in 2000 and once again put back on, to Oxycotin to help with the pain and to constipate me, but I cannot even function when I take it. I go to my gastroenterologist about five to seven times a month, and since I have been diagnosed I have been hospitalized about 46 times. Now that is a lot of money and timed I have wasted. I say I have wasted it because I have just gotten worse.So far that is my story - no happy ending and unfortunately I don't see one in sight. I don't want sympathy. I wrote this mainly to help me and to let all you other women know out there that you are not alone. I also wanted to write this because I want people who don't have this horrible illness to read it and put themselves in my shoes, or your shoes and see how they would feel.

220,"Pretty much like everyone else, my first IBS symptoms appeared when I was a young teenager - 7th or 8th grade I believe to be exact. At the time, I only experienced the mind-numbing pain, cramps, and diarrhea if I went for a run too soon after eating or drinking anything. I would be around two blocks from home (well, it was a country road, so to my best estimate) where the pain I started feeling slightly earlier in the run (which I would try to ignore) would get so bad I would have to stop and would then painfully walk in slow-motion to the house - desperate to get to the loo.If I remember correctly, up until the time I had my first (and only) child at age 26, I only felt this horrible pain (cramps, diarrhea) because of eating or drinking too soon before exercising, so I would usually try to wait a while before exercising to avoid this, but other times I would become impatient and of course suffer the consequences. I could deal with it though.Then I had a child and I think the pressure of the child on my already sensitive bowels/intestines made the problem much worse. Ever since then, I have had horrible gas problems, bloating, much more painful cramps, and alternating diarrhea with constipation. Now the IBS symptoms happen whether I am exercising too soon after eating or not.The problem has worsened over the past seven years (I'm 33 now) - back in January 1997 (four months after having my child) I ended up in the ER - which did not sit well with me because I had not been on my new job long enough to qualify for health insurance and of course I ended up having to pay the exorbitant  cost on my own, for what I call 'not much help.'I ended up waiting two hours to be seen by the doctor - by that time the pain had mysteriously disappeared. I told him I was having extreme pain in the right side of my abdomen - he ruled out what it wasn't and told me it was a problem possibly with the area where my small and large intestine join (splenix I believe), but didn't offer any advice or medication.After that, nothing major ever happened that painful so I went on living - never went to see a doctor to tell him I had periodic IBS and I needed help (I diagnosed it myself), but the last two years I have had several severe instances where the IBS symptoms would just pop up out of the blue it would seem.I am never sure what brings them on - sometimes I can eat certain foods, other times it seems I can't. I love to cook and love eating a large variety of foods, especially spicy ones, so I cannot live off of just bland foods. I hope it is not spicy foods that affect me - I don't know - I used to eat them all the time with no effect. I don't eat much dairy, though now I eat yogurt as I heard it adds good bacteria back into your intestines - not sure if it works yet.Last summer on a vacation with my friend in Izmir, Turkey, I had the worst stomach cramps for a whole week, which had a negative impact on my vacation (I thought it was from the fish I ate the night before, not sure). Then soon after that I think got food poisoning at the Taco Bell I ate at on the Tuzla army base in Bosnia because within 30 minutes I was in severe pain.I went to the doctor on camp (I was in Camp Sarajevo - I am in the Navy Reserves and volunteered for two missions in Yugoslavia) and as I lay there on the table she asked me if I had a lot of gas as she prodded my abdomen - it's like, what do you think? She thought it was just gas-related even though I tried to tell her it was most likely food poisoning. She gave me some mild chewable tablets and that was it! They didn't work all that well, but the pain did subside in a week.Since then I have had other incidents - another this past June, where I went to another army doctor (I thought it was related to my reproductive parts). He did a pregnancy test, I had the sonogram done, blood tests, an internal vagina exam, etc - nothing, so I left. I then realized it was IBS!I didn't think so before since my periods had become erratic, but it turns out that was not related to the pains I was experiencing. I told him so upon a return visit to medical to out-process and he just wrote probably IBS. I definitely think doctors do not think of IBS as serious - as many of you have mentioned - they should walk in our shoes for a day when we are feeling intense pain and I guarantee you they would have some medicine that would work (and as most doctors are men and most cases of IBS are with women, it's no wonder...)And to end this - just last night or rather at five o'clock in the morning - I woke up with these incredible cramps - painful - so painful I kept saying 'let me be,' and 'I hate pain.'

I was given some medication for the terrible cramps all throughout my lower belly, a diet of sorts, some exercises to do and to not be too far from a bathroom if I had the diarrhea which was usually the case. On rare occasions it was just terrible cramps and constipation, so I would drink lots of water which would bloat me up, but eventually after lying down on the bed on one side and then the other, the gurgling would start, followed by the cramps and then the immediate urge to have a bowel movement which left me on the bowl, doubled over with terrible pains, for well over an hour.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));At school, in my early years, I had a few accidents either in class due to diarrhea or on the train, and later, driving home from wherever I was. I was given something for the diarrhea as well and eventually, it just stopped, but I will say it was no fun when I had cramps with my period and the IBS was there too. My belly could hardly take it.I used to walk the floors and massage my poor belly until I could just sit up and cry from the pain of both. Finally my period came and the cramps eased up within a day, but the IBS was still there. My belly was extremely bloated and I tried to rest for my period of which I still was a little bit crampy.By the second day, the period cramps stopped but the IBS was still growing strong and then the diarrhea started and that was like non-stop for a couple of days with cramps so bad, it felt like someone actually punched me in my belly. I cried and cried. Nothing was helping, but I massaged my belly, walked the floors and had to keep running to the bathroom. That was some 30 years ago.I have not had an attack for 30 years. Until today. I have been under a lot of stress lately and was having some mild cramps plus I had the flu, so I just figured it was that. The flu is essentially done with after two weeks, but the cramps started really badly yesterday. I wasn't sure what to make of it, so I drank some cola and ginger ale so as not to dehydrate.This morning I got up and went to the bathroom. Boy did I have cramps in my belly. I took my meds and some more ginger ale and I could hardly walk back to the bed. The entire lower portion of my belly was and still is killing me. I have had diarrhea almost all day and of course with that and the most horrible cramps in my belly, I knew I was having a severe attack of IBS after all these years.I could hardly touch any food, because everything I ate came right out and my belly is just so bad, I can only pray that I will get some sleep tonight. I took the diarrhea and pain meds but neither helped. As it is Saturday I called the doctor's office and got the PA on the phone and she did agree that it sounds like a full-blown IBS attack.Her major suggestion was when the diarrhea eased up, to lie on my bed or couch and try and sleep because I might get woken up with the severe cramping again in the night. She also told me to put a hot water bottle on my belly in bed. Not sure it'll work, but anything is worth a try.I am 55 years old now, living with my dog in PA and very lonely. Anyone that has any suggestions for these awful pains, please write me. Just when I thought I was over it, back it came.Update on Joan...Joan here again. I am posting again in the hopes that I get some good replies. Just send directly to me and reference something about IBS in the subject. I am not on every day, but promise to get back to you shortly.My belly has been acting up quite a bit lately. I have spoken to my doctor on a couple of occasions and he has tried different medications as well as bland foods. However, I wake up in the morning with a bloated belly and the gurgling starts soon. I take all of my medications, not only for the IBS, but this as well.The doctor told me to drink hot water with a bit of lemon, sipping it slowly. I usually take it to my bedside, so I can sit and massage the cramping that has already started. The doctor has me on calcium with vitamin D and a cranberry tab and other vitamins as well. I basically get really constipated and bad cramps after drinking the hot water with lemon but he says it will flush the system.I then lie back down on the bed and look at my belly which by now is so totally bloated, it is hard to decide which way to rest. I sometimes massage the intestines but then the gurgling starts up even more and I get up and walk the floors.I often take my dog out for a walk and just as I am picking up after him, I get such a severe gas pain in my belly, I hurry him along and I put his drippings in the dumpster and by then the cramps are almost unbearable. I wash my hands and sit on the age of the bed rocking and grabbing my belly and doubling over. Sometimes drinking enough fluids, I finally do go.I had a severe cramp all day, still do, and my fiance doesn't understand, so I would appreciate hearing from someone who does.

223,"I am 21 and have only recently (the last month or two) discovered that I have IBS. I do find stress aggravates my symptoms and no particular food makes it better or worse. Although my symptoms are not overly severe, I get diarrhea once or twice a week usually and a lot of abdominal pain. I fear it will get worse and since there is no actual known cure, my fear is heightened. I also suffer from emetephobia (fear of vomiting) which makes all this harder.I find depression is starting to become a part of my everyday life as well, due to IBS and my social anxiety disorder. I do hope that one day a cure, or at least something that will improve IBS symptoms dramatically, is discovered so we can all rest and enjoy life.E-mail Ashley:[email protected]",,email,stress,food,pain,vomiting,depression,depression,anxiety,disorder,
224,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));Hello, I'm Diana, I'm 20 and I study music at university in London. My symptoms started off quite mildly. I simply remember not a day passing as a child where I didn't have a stomach cramp. These were dismissed by teachers as attention seeking or exaggeration. However, at that time I never had any problems with my stools.When I got to around the age of 12, I noticed that passing wind would help relieve the pain, which at that time could get so bad it made me feel nauseous. But for a child that spends all their time at school with friends, passing wind was not always welcome, and I had one or two embarrassing moments where my colon would make itself heard! I also began to get constipated sometimes.This carried on for the next few years, until about last year, when the pain was always accompanied by diarrhea. I thought this was a passing phase, and I thought it would stop if I discontinued to eat dairy products. A mistake I have learned many people have made.In my gap year, I worked in a cafe which had one staff toilet which was also used by customers, but which had no ventilation whatsoever. I developed horribly painful stomach cramps and diarrhea at work, and would lock myself in the bathroom but refuse to go to the toilet, and wait for the pain to go away (only for it to come back again in 20 minutes!).However, in the end, I felt that I was being so poisoned by what was in my bowel that I didn't care anymore, I just sat on the toilet and went for ages. Eventually I had to tell the owner, who was incredibly understanding and would let me have a timeout when I was having an attack.I had cut out most of the dairy food in my diet, but my IBS was getting worse, so by this time I was afraid to eat. I was gassy, in pain, nauseous, had headaches, frequent loose stools and general fear to go out! The only thing I could bring myself to eat at that point was lettuce and water.Around this time, I also had my pianoforte auditions to get into London conservatoires. You can imagine what the stress and nervousness did to my bowel. Performing, I was in so much pain, and was just relieved when it was over because I could finally go to the toilet and let it all out! Needless to say, I didn't get accepted to the conservatoires.Today, I found this website, read the story on the front page and cried. It is such a relief to know that other people feel this too, and that I have it good compared to some. The fear I feel is indescribable when I know I need to get to the toilet, and I know what is in store. Sometimes, when I'm in pain, I wonder if childbirth will be as bad as this.Nothing seems to help, but saying that I haven't tried many remedies yet. I just shut up and go, and hope no-one can hear me crying in the toilet. I have to mention I live with my boyfriend in shared accommodation with six other people, and there are only two toilets, so it is imperative I don't draw attention to myself when I am having a bad attack, which now seems to be every weekend without fail.When I tell university friends, they just say 'Oh Diana, I didn't want to know that, that's disgusting!', but how else do I answer why I wasn't in the day before, or why I am sitting there looking miserable? What would they have preferred to hear? That I couldn't be bothered, like them, to come in? I'm not going to lie just because they are too disgusted to hear the truth.Thankfully, I get relief in the form of my mother. She has suffered from IBS since childhood, and she helps me, and understands, and doesn't say 'yuck' when I describe my recent stool to her. My boyfriend also makes excuses for me at restaurants when I have disappeared to the bathroom for an unacceptable period of time.To be honest, I have never experienced sympathy from others when I tell them what's wrong (apart, of course, from my amazing mother), only the presumption that it's purely psychological, or, more frequently, reactions of discomfort tinged with disgust, like how dare you mention your bowels to us.Anyway, it was a relief to get that off my chest! I don't think my condition is severe, although I do feel constantly bloated, like I want to fart all the time, and just the thought of coffee or dairy makes me want to open my bowels there and then, even if my stomach isn't cramping! I keep hoping for a miracle cure, or anything to feel normal again. And I think I always will.E-mail Diana:[email protected]",,toilet,pain,stomach,dairy,child,email,mother,boyfriend,people,conservatoire
225,"Hi, my name is Sarah and I have IBS. I was diagnosed with this disease at 18, on new year's day of 2004. For a while no one knew what it was and everyone just thought it was stress.

I also take Buscopan for the pain.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I find it very hard to deal with that feeling of 'I won't make it to the toilet in time.' And the anxiety and panic attacks. Before I got this disease I never realized how common and horrible IBS really is and unfortunately how much I took normal life for granted.I hate feeling like this. I find it very hard to feel that it is impossible to do things that I used to enjoy, ie I'm going to the hairdresser on Thursday and I worry so much that I could lay down and die.I miss seeing my friends but like so many of you say, no-one really understands and pretty much thinks I should just get over it.

226,"I have just been diagnosed with IBS. Until recently the worst it got was cramps and some minor leakage occasionally. Although this obviously wasn't ideal I could cope with it. But in the last three months, whilst waiting for a consultant's appointment, I have had 10 accidents. They are becoming more and more frequent and I am scared to go anywhere in case I cannot get to a toilet.Yesterday was the worst ever. About an hour after I got to work I developed severe stomach cramps and bloating. I wrestled with it for half an hour but knew it wouldn't go away. I spent about half an hour on the toilet at work doubled up in pain. In the end I told my boss I was unwell and went to the train station.I only have a five minute journey home but had to wait 20 minutes for the train to arrive. I was in agony for those 20 minutes, either pacing up and down or sitting on the bench doubled up. When the train arrived I got on and walked along trying to find the toilet.By this time I was coming out in cold sweats and felt very ill. I got to the point where I just had to sit down because of the pain. A few seconds after I did this I had a diarrhea explosion, then another and then another.Luckily I was wearing a long coat but the diarrhea was trickling down my trousers. I made it out to the corridor and went in the toilet to finish 
off. As I was doing so we got to my station and I had to get out of the carriage.I walked the five minute journey home praying I wouldn't meet anyone I knew and that no-one could see the mess. When I got home I spent the next eight hours on and off the toilet. I then woke up this morning to find I'd been badly incontinent in the night.I'm off work today with cramps and a painful, bloated stomach. I've just come to the conclusion that I need to wear some protection and have just ordered some pants. Hopefully, this will mean I don't have to worry so much about toilets. I just hope the doctor can help me. I'm only 25 and don't want to spend the rest of my life like this.E-mail Sadie:[email protected]",,toilet,train,home,cramp,email,stomach,job,pain,station,corridor
227,"After reading all of the messages here I feel relieved to hear that I am not the only one whose life has been disrupted by IBS. IBS is no laughing matter; it clearly has driven many to feel isolated, depressed and suicidal. It has prevented people from living out their dreams and ambitions, and even day-to-day simple tasks. I have been truly shocked and saddened by some of the stories of those with really severe symptoms. I just cannot believe that there is no real cure or treatment for this.I am 21 and have suffered the 'usual' symptoms of stomach cramps, discomfort, bloating, and diarrhea for about four months now. Since the 
problems began I have lost about a stone in weight, my confidence is severely dented and I have suffered anxiety attacks.I can completely relate to all of those people who have mental maps of all the nearest toilets; my paranoia is also due to a constant feeling of 
the need to urinate, which I think might be an associated problem!The big problem that I am having at the moment is that I am a recent graduate, but have had to leave my potentially fulfilling and successful career because I was unable to do the job properly...meetings, liaising, and working in the office all became impossible due to the constant discomfort and embarrassment. I am consequently feeling like a bit of a leper and a failure!I am now trying to find a job that is less stressful and allows me to cope better with the symptoms, but am finding it really tough and it looks 
like I might not get much use out of my degree. If anyone has any ideas about jobs that are flexible enough to do with IBS then please post a 
message on the site, as this seems to be a recurring issue...as there isn't sick pay available, and there isn't even recognition of this debilitating 
condition in the medical profession! Jobs anyone, any ideas, I'm very bright and going to waste here!E-mail Natasha:[email protected]",,job,email,people,attack,profession,medical,condition,meeting,graduate,graduate
228,"Hi there, I would just like to say about how much I hate IBS. I was diagnosed as of yesterday and have suffered for over two years before this diagnosis. I just hate the fact that it is not really a serious illness as people think you are making it up and that I make myself go to the toilet, it really infuriates me.I am a 20 year-old girl who feels like a recluse, who cannot step outside the house for fear of the dreaded diarrhea hitting while I am out. I feel really disheartened at the moment with the medical profession who just comment that 'It's IBS' or comment that there are no answers as it's just one of those things which contribute to our lifestyle, stress and daily diet.Also, it annoys me with the fact that many doctors are handing out the diagnosis of IBS to people who may not have it and I feel annoyed as these people do not seem to suffer as much as I have (quite selfish I know).I have not found any relief for my symptoms of chronic diarrhea and stomach pains as of yet. I take Imodium but I feel that starts a cycle of 
constipation and diarrhea for me. I am really interested in alternative remedies as I have read many success stories of this.If people would like to contact me with any advice for me or simply tell me their story I would welcome them gladly and will reply to you. I live in the UK and am 20 years old.

229,"I am 27 years old and I don't remember a time in my life when I've had totally normal bowel function. However, just before I married, about three years ago, the symptoms escalated considerably.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Sometimes I feel like I am rambling on and on to everyone about my symptoms, trying to prove that I really am sick, even though I know they probably get tired of hearing it. It's nice to have somewhere to tell my story, just for the sake of telling it, and knowing that someone might actually be interested in what I have to say.The pattern that I seem to have is constipation - not always total, some days I just know I'm not going as much as I should be. Then, after a few days of that, I get cramps and spasms so horrible that I've told my husband this has to be what childbirth feels like, even though we have no children.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));On one hand, it makes me feel like I'll be able to handle labor pain. I have seen some other women on this site who have compared their IBS pain to labor pain, and it helps to validate my feelings. After the pain subsides, I am usually exhausted - shaky and needing to lie down. My whole body seems to tense up in an effort to fight the pain.With the spasms I may or may not have diarrhea, but what I almost always have for sure is three to four days of severe soreness and bloating, with gas that hurts terribly as it floats around in there. My last attack left me doubled over, walking as slowly as possible, for half a day before I could stand up straight.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I have been blessed - and I believe it is the grace of God - that I have avoided having any accidents as a result of it, although I've had some close calls. Asian food (MSG?) for me is more or less off-limits now, as it almost always causes a near accident for me, before I can even get home from the restaurant.I have some form of discomfort every day - gas, bloating, nausea - but I still basically live my life just as I would without the illness. It is an 
embarrassing illness, but I find that most people I have to explain it to are extremely sympathetic and polite. Long car rides and staying in other people's homes don't frighten me - I deal with them as they come. It has, however, caused me to miss enough work that my employer is working on some form of disability loophole so I can keep my job.I've been given Bentyl and fiber therapy, which have proven to make the symptoms worse by causing gas, or causing other symptoms such as drowsiness which don't help me function normally any more than the symptoms do. I've had an upper GI and an ultrasound (my symptoms are terribly exacerbated by menstrual hormones) and I am scheduled for a colonoscopy. My guess is they'll find nothing but good old IBS.I've heard a little bit about IBS causing weight gain, and I'm beginning to wonder about the merits of that theory, because I have gained 70 pounds since my symptoms began to worsen, and the last two times I attempted a weight loss program, I spent an entire month losing and re-gaining the same eight or so pounds.Sometimes weight loss seems hopeless, because so many fruits and vegetables make me sick and if I get too hungry, I'm in pain. Also, the 
constipation-diarrhea pattern can make your weight vary so drastically from day to day that very few of my weigh-ins are encouraging.Hopefully someone will see this story and realize they're not alone, they're going to be okay, and they can still live their lives. I believe God 
is a healer and I can only trust that He has a purpose for this illness in this point of my life. I pray everyone who visits this site finds a way to 
manage their IBS. Thank you for allowing me to 'gripe' about mine.E-mail Mandy:[email protected]",,pain,weight,weight,gas,constipation,email,loss,job,people,home
230,"I stumbled across this website in a desperate cry to find others who I can relate to with this depressing disease. My first IBS bout came about two years ago. I was going through a very stressful time and let's just say I had 'the accident'. It brought on an onslaught of anxiety problems with it.Like so many of you, I too fear leaving the house. It is a nightmare. I only feel safe at home where I know there is a clean toilet and that I can relax. I refuse to car pool with people for those unexpected 'got to go' times that happen so often when I drive.I work about 45 miles from home and I call in sick a lot. My job has been on the line. Traffic always seems to know when I have to go and I find that the more worked up I get in it when I have to go, the worse it gets. I refuse to eat out, and my fiance gets very frustrated with me because I won't go to social events for fear of having to 'go'. I sing and play guitar in a rock band and can't even hang around after a show cause usually I am so nervous I have to race home to go to the bathroom.I also suffer from emetophobia, which is the fear of vomiting. I can't be around it, do it, see it, hear it. I have done it once in my life (knock on wood). I get the worst panic attacks if I am around it. I now feel as if I am becoming phobic of having the runs too.This is no way to live. I can't enjoy a normal life. Every day my stomach is in turmoil and prevents me from doing a plethora of things. It is always on my mind...I'm going to have to go. My doctors say it's stress-induced IBS, they won't test me or anything unless I have black stool or blood in my stool. Damn HMOs.I am miserable. I feel robbed of joyous moments in my life. I have tried altering my diet and exercise but nothing really has helped. You know those people that are 'autotrophs'? They don't need food or water?

I dread going out for dinner with my other half, he understands but I still get quite embarrassed by the whole thing.One time we went out for dinner to this really expensive place, I said to the waitress 'please no citrus', 30 minutes later she brings me my food with a huge piece of lemon on it, I was too embarrassed to say anything (did not want to make trouble, plus I did not want to wait another 30 minutes for my food).So I took the lemon off and started eating. I was feeling fine for about 15 minutes, then all of a sudden everything in my head fell to my feet, I was getting sweaty and went all pale.

During school I would beg my teachers to let me go home because I could hardly stand up. It went away for about four years while I was in high school, which made everyone think that my stomach aches were due to stress.After graduating high school I started getting these horrible gassy stomach aches again. I went to the doctor and she said it was anxiety and put me on Zoloft. Well, the Zoloft didn't help and I went back to the doctors. She sent me to a specialist OBGYN who diagnosed me with endometriosis and I had a surgery to fix it.Well guess what?

235,"Throughout high school my IBS was pretty well under control. I went to the bathroom several times a day, but luckily at that time didn't need any medication for the symptoms I was having. After being in an abusive relationship at 16 my symptoms worsened to the point that I could barely eat, I pretty much ate Maalox tablets all day and clocked in at the doctor's at 88 and a half pounds. My GP diagnosed me with IBS, and put me on an anti-depressant that made me gain weight and helped me to be 'hungry' again.At 17 when the ordeal was mostly over I met Keith, who one of my close art class friends had introduced me to. Needless to say, he's the man of my dreams and we've been together almost five years now. Engaged. And going to graduate school. He's completely turned my life around.Over the past few years I gained the weight back to where I should be (since I'm only five feet tall I weighed around 115) and all seemed to be well. We moved out of our parents' homes to live together and go to college at the age of 18. I ended up still putting more weight on...by the age of 21 I weighed 167 (pretty hefty for my frame) and on my 22nd birthday is where it all began.At the time I was working at a veterinary hospital and after a night of eating party foods wasn't feeling too bad. I remember around 7:30 having these horrible sudden stomach pains. Running to the bathroom I thought I was just going to have bad diarrhea from a bug I may have caught or something. Pouring with sweat and aching they sent me home early.After getting home I proceeded to 'go' blood, and when I was still going in the morning my parents told me to go to a doctor. They did tests which showed the obvious, blood in my stool, and referred me to a specialist.My specialist admitted me to the hospital for a colonoscopy (ugh) and to sum it all up, after two night and three days in the hospital I was diagnosed with diverticular disease, a bad gallbladder, and colitis. I ended up going to see a GI later who said he wasn't totally convinced I had had an attack of diverticulitis, even though I have the diverticulosis. He said he was sure it was severe IBS.Needless to say, he prescribed me Levsin SL (which happens to work for me, I'm very lucky that it does), and off I went. To this day, I started out as IBS-diarrhea (which was never really diarrhea, but was loose and happened around four times a day) and now I have bouts of both, going two days with diarrhea, and another with constipation.I take Metamucil every day which seems to help my stool form, and I've also had an attack where I woke up at 3am with horrible upper abdominal pains to the point where I was hunched over crying and begging for help or any kind of relief from the pain. I pray to God it doesn't happen again. My fiancè was very close to taking me to the ER. It seemed like after I relieved myself I was better and took one of my pills, the cramping stopped and I could go back to sleep. Fitfully of course.Things that seem to work for me other than my pills that I have to take four times a day - eating fruits, especially apples, seems to help me a lot. Since I was hospitalized six months ago I have lost almost 40 pounds and feel healthier. I still have my IBS attacks every month, and go back and forth between D and C (seems to be a constant battle).Even though someday I'll still need to have my gallbladder out, I'm continuing a strict diet and still trying to find little hints about how to help the cramping and abdominal discomfort that I have almost daily.

symptoms and made the assumption that IBS was the cause of all this. Since loss of so much weight wasn't a symptom I had come across, I decided to be safe and get it checked out.I did the barium testing (anyone who has done this understands when I say 'Casper poop'). I did the special diets with the stool samples (having poo in your fridge really isn't visitor friendly).And, finally, they informed me that I would need a colonoscopy. I was terrified! I was convinced that a 19 year-old shouldn't have to do such a thing! I went through with it and, honestly, it wasn't that bad. The induced diarrhea was much less painful then what I was used to!After it all, they diagnosed me with IBS. My GI offered me pills but not without a cost. The side effect was 'severe fatigue'. Being a full-time student and a full-time manager at a restaurant/brewery doesn't allow for that.I am now about to be 20 and still struggling. I wonder if people can develop social anxiety disorder from IBS. I don't go out much anymore, and if I do, I am paranoid and uncomfortable...understandably. I am so fed-up, though. I am 20 years old and I feel 80. I shouldn't have to deal with all this.I have supportive friends, family, and a boyfriend. But I don't think they see that my jokes are just a cover-up. I have tried high fiber diets, but it only makes it worse. The most successful diet for me consists of carbs, carbs, carbs...and sometimes some chicken or veggies. My weight is still all over the place causing me to buy new clothes frequently.

I've had chronic diarrhea for five years, since I was 16. It has gradually gotten worse over the years. The state I'm in now I can't imagine how I managed to get through sixth form! Doctors haven't really made any effort to find possible causes and appear very apathetic to how my IBS is totally destroying my life!I developed anxiety attacks within six months of initially getting chronic diarrhea. They started due to the fear of needing the loo in the middle of class and having to run out making an exhibition of myself! Now my bowel control is so bad I worry about people discovering a funny smell coming from my trousers!Fortunately I have not yet suffered a public accident...but this is because I hardly ever go out! My anxiety got so bad I couldn't attend tutorials and seminars so transferred to the Open University where I'm completing my degree from home. (I advise this to others who find attending university difficult!)I used to be such a sociable happy person with lots of friends. I now only have the one or two close friends who try really hard to understand my problem...but no matter how hard they try...they don't have to handle the constant fear of having to dash to the loo with the possibility of not making it in time, and the cold sweats that flood through my body numerous times a day.It's the worst when I'm driving somewhere and I desperately need the loo! The lights seems to always be on red, and traffic jams emerge...at times like this I've just cried and cried...praying for the pain to go and that I get home before I soil myself. I now avoid driving!My strategy of coping with it now is not really eating very much at all! I go out of the house about two days a week after not having eaten for two days and having taken loads of anti-diarrhea tablets. I've managed to maintain friendships this way, however, my degree is coming to a close and I will need to get a job very soon...I hate having to depend on my parents for finance and simple things like going to the shops to buy food because I'm not well enough.The problem now is coping with anxiety and chronic diarrhea...I don't know how I'll ever get a job or boyfriend at this rate! A day doesn't go by that I don't wish I was just normal...and do simple things like pop down to a local shop. I constantly battle with anger and depression about how IBS has done this to my life.

Nobody I know has symptoms anything like mine, even those who say they have IBS. I'm lucky in that I have a very understanding husband who would do anything for me if I asked - but at the times I am suffering most I just want him as far away as possible.My IBS started at the age of 13. I'm now in my 30s. I was too embarrassed to discuss it with my mother and would sit in the toilet for hours on end wanting to die, suffering from gas, bloating and chronic diarrhea with mucous. I got to know the pattern on the floor so well.I got scared to go away and when I did go to guide camp, I remember spending most of one night, having walked about half a mile from my tent to the toilet block, freezing and shivering in the cubicle rather than risk going back to the tent and getting the pains again.I eventually went to the doctor who diagnosed appendicitis and had me in for surgery. Needless to say that didn't cure anything. I had all sorts of tests including abarium enema, and at one point was on 12 tablets a day, but nothing ever worked. I ended up stopping taking them.It has been on and off I suppose really all these years, and nothing in particular seems to aggravate it - stress doesn't seem to make it worse.

You need to get a 'good' batch though - the best are made with a strong peppermint oil base rather than just chalky. It's the only thing that relieves my wind and pain in any way, but it's quite hard to get hold of.

I have been suffering with serious constipation and 
bloating for about a year now - I constantly look six months pregnant and hurt all the time. I suffer from almost permanent urinary tract infections 
which don't seem to clear even after antibiotics - does anyone else have this?My bladder always feels like there is pressure on it. I did have some tests about 10 years ago for this, including an incredibly painful tube up into my bladder, but nothing was discovered. Is it likely to be IBS causing this constant pain/discomfort, does anyone know?Recently my 'attacks' have been getting worse when I have them, even though they are still far apart and strike without warning. One of the worst was on holiday driving through France. My husband only just managed to pull into a service area before I had to run and find the toilet. Thank God there was one.I spent about an hour and a half in there thinking I was going to die, having diarrhea and vomiting onto a pile of toilet paper I had managed to 
throw onto the floor. I was soaked in sweat that literally ran from every area of my body. This happened again fairly recently at a friend's party - I just managed to run into her bathroom where I threw up all over her towel (the only thing I could grab in the panic and put on the floor in front of me while I had diarrhea).The worst episode ever came this weekend though, which was what prompted me to finally look online for anyone else as I feel so alone and abnormal. In the middle of my family meal with my husband and daughter I experienced the familiar stirrings - gurgling and pain in my lower abdomen, slight nausea and sweat and crampy type wobbly pains in my thighs.I just made it to the bathroom and grabbed the waste bin. I really genuinely thought I was going to die. If I had been able to move, or to speak, or to even think clearly I would have called my husband to get an ambulance. My heartbeat was so fast I couldn't count it (not that I was in any state to in the first place), I was so dizzy and disoriented I felt like I was hallucinating.I was sat On the toilet in agony suffering terrible spasms that wouldn't let me straighten up, bent literally double with my hands on the floor, trying to support myself while I vomited into the bin. The sweat ran off me soaking my clothes and pooling onto the floor, I could feel it dripping off me and running up into my eyes and nose as my head was upside down.I don't know how I managed not to pass out - I was blacking out in-between spasms, my eyes closing and rolling and arms giving way, my body trying to slide onto the floor, not helped by the amount of sweat making me slide off the seat. Thank God I got through it. I don't know how. I didn't even have the strength to wipe off the vomit from my face that I could feel hanging there. There is nothing so disgusting in this life. It was actually worse than giving birth, which I went through with no painkillers at all, not even gas and air.I'm OKish now, still weak and sore.

I know if I get upset or worked up, then I will really suffer. However, sometimes if I am totally calm, just sitting around the house, I will get sick. I cannot understand IBS. All I understand is that it is a horrible disease to have and it is really overlooked by people, doctors especially. I have had all sorts of tests and have taken all sorts of medicines.

I will probably try reflexology as I have heard that can be helpful.I don't really know what I am asking you for - it is helping a bit reading other people's stories - as I say above I was not aware my back pain was an IBS thing - this has only come on in the last week or so and I was getting panicky that it was related to something else, but as my stomach has been so bad over the last three weeks I can understand it now.Hopefully I will have a happy tale to tell about this at some point.

263,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I'm a 27-year-old woman from Essex, and I was diagnosed with IBS four years ago - my boyfriend and I had been on a two-week holiday, and I only went to the loo once, so he insisted I see the doctor. One blood test and rectal examination later I was diagnosed.Until then, I'd been in denial. Bloating wasn't so predominant (it is now, sadly), I drank and ate 'normal' dairy, spicy foods and fats - the things which trigger an attack now - without really thinking about it. In 2000, I went to Greece and had gastroenteritis for three or four days, and I think it stemmed from that, although I tended towards frequent loo stops during my teens. After that, the fact that I hardly went to the loo is something I can't now believe I ignored!Now I alternate between IBS-C and D. On the morning of my wedding, I didn't leave the loo. Today, I've made some movements, but they were 'reluctant' to say the least. I suffer right-sided pain and bad wind. The cramps have died down in the last 14 months since I started having Actimel everyday, now I only get them every now and then.Mentally, this is so challenging. I can't count how many times I've been driving and just need to go to the loo, the times people start a long conversation and all I can think of is how I need to get to the loo. The times I've bought a nice outfit, only to try it on and I look five months pregnant.I've had at least five doctors since being diagnosed. They have varied - one was extremely knowledgeable and a real help, but the last one upset me the most, saying it was psychological - yes, I've changed jobs, planned a wedding and had a relative die in the last 12 months, but what about the years before that? I came home crying; I wish I had had this website to show him.Love-life - well you all know how sexy you feel when you're constipated and bloated! I've been lucky as my husband is very understanding, he makes my hot water bottles and lends a sympathetic ear. But last night we couldn't got to the pub because I was so bloated from constipation (and therefore uncomfortable), so it has a knock-on effect on our social life.Other people - dairy's my enemy but people still give me chocolates, my husband buys cheesecake, I'm still offered ice-cream as a dessert (I'm not too bad with cheese and yogurt). My friends have got very used to me moaning, but always question why I'm not drinking (I try to avoid too much alcohol), why I'm not having pudding, and put too much milk in my tea.Positives - I find exercise helps, four times a week doing running or aerobics. I try to keep relaxed and not to literally tense up my stomach; but I can be on holiday very relaxed and only worrying about where the next ray of sunshine is coming from, and I'm still affected. Linseeds before I go to bed have helped, and I've just started using Regucol so I'll see how that goes.Anyway, that's far too long a story for anyone to read, but at least I've got it off my chest, and I am so relieved that this website is here for me, and us.Update on Joy...Earlier this year I was going to write that my IBS really has almost stopped to the point I was only using over-the-counter Movicol if I hadn't used the loo for a couple of days (I was C to D usually). I wasn't sure whether to attribute it to turning vegan (as I'm on the fence when it comes to IBS related to diet) but certainly since last December I had noticed I didn't really suffer any bad spells, and just got attacks when I'd had too much fiber.All of that ended last month, and my doctor now says I'm having a bad spell. My flatulence knocks grown men over if they're walking behind me, I've felt nauseous at times, and I can't remember the last time I saw my toes (my stomach has suffered less bloating this year). My appetite is also really out of kilter. A pharmacist prescribed Colpermin which worked for a couple of days, then the doctor prescribed mebeverine which I've taken for a week with very mixed results (overall, no change unfortunately).I'm so unhappy about this - the only things that have changed for me since the beginning of September is that I now eat apples (I wore a brace until then) and I wear a retainer since the brace removal. Perhaps apples were always a culprit but they never caused me such a problem in the past. Perhaps my retainer hygiene isn't what it could be, but then having a brace was hardly the height of infection control.I guess I should have 'touched wood' when I caught myself thinking 'maybe the IBS has gone away for the foreseeable future'. If anyone has had a similar experience of going at least a year without too much hassle, then suddenly you get what you've been told is an attack, I'd like to swap shoulders to cry on.E-mail Joy:[email protected]",,doctor,doctor,people,attack,attack,attack,attack,brace,email,stomach
264,"I've had IBS for as long as I can remember, so let's say 30 years, as I am now 30 and was basically born with GI problems. I suffered through constipation in childhood (was hospitalized for it at one point) as well as diarrhea (hospitalized for that and accused, at the age of 10, of being anorexic...though at fault were the doctors that had me on four tablespoons of mineral oil each day).My problems, as I got older, caused hemorrhoids (I had to have surgery...can definitely say you should get banding and have them treated as 
opposed to leaving them and having them go necrotic like I did!) and other problems. As I've matured the constipation is less frequent - I can go a week without going, but it always resolves in diarrhea now.I've got two children, and I suffered wicked constipation through my first pregnancy (and a blocked bowel from iron pills) and experienced 
pre-term labor as a result (though I did carry to term). With the second pregnancy I had diarrhea the whole time...I spent two hours on the toilet the day before my second boy was born and had a brutal bout again two days after he was born.My youngest always wanted to be with me, so even in the middle of the night we'd be found in the bathroom with him in his bouncy chair or 
cot (or, when the urge was instant, in a pile of towels thrown onto the floor to keep him comfy). I'm lucky that my hubby is quite understanding. He has never really suffered anything like this, but he was on high dose antibiotics once so did have one day where it was like having IBS.My most recent symptoms are severe pain across my back at the bottom of the ribs, which is followed by brutal diarrhea within the hour. I get bloating, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, gas (hubby never farts...I'm a total fart factory and it is rarely controllable), heartburn...all that good stuff.So now the embarrassing part...For my 30th birthday hubby decided to get me a gift certificate for a fine dining restaurant. We got a sitter (thank goodness for grandparents!) and headed out for a 5pm dinner. It was a wonderful place. Had my ginger ale, then we had a bruschetta appetizer. It was great! I ordered a small steak, mushrooms, roasted potatoes and veggies.I got about a quarter of the way through the meal when the nausea hit. I made a quick run to the bathroom (I thought if I stood up for a few minutes it might pass). Made it back to the table after five minutes (the place was not busy so it was very obvious where I was). Ate a couple more bites, and then the pain started. Told hubby quietly what was going on and that we needed to get home ASAP. Waiter came and we asked to have them box up the leftovers as well as dessert. Unfortunately I then had to make a run again.I spent 20 minutes in the bathroom (wow...those fine dining places have amazing bathrooms! The weird thing was that the toilet kept flushing on auto-flush every minute or so). When I finally made it back to the table hubby was sitting there with our boxed-up food and we paid and left. They kept looking at me and I found out after that they'd asked hubby if I was OK and if the food was making me sick! He said he told them I'd been feeling unwell all day.So my big birthday dinner, which cost us over $100 (for two people who don't drink that is a huge bill...especially when only one of us can work full-time!) turned into an embarrassing experience and I'm mortified. I made it the 10-minute drive home and went again...then ate dessert and was fine the rest of the day.I hate my IBS! It factors into everything to the point that I always make sure we've got extra kid diapers in the car and a garbage bag and roll of toilet paper in case I have an accident!

I begged her to help as I now was suicidal. My life revolved round the loo and cramps with the occasional accident which is awful. My daughter was very ill and needed me. So the GP referred me to a dietician who I thought was a joke and told me to keep a symptom diary! But this was a revelation. I worked out my trigger foods before I had the dietician's appointment.My problematic foods have been coffee, gluten and the worst of all fiber and stress. This was in May and I have done so well easing well down my Lomotil and going a day for the first time in years without any meds (although now I have to take a multivitamin).Then yesterday and today have been awful and I have had an accident out of the blue, which has left me down and upset, and wanting to cancel our holiday. Hubby thinks it is because I am due a period and my IBS is always much worse then. Sorry for prattling on but it has helped me.We have a holiday soon and the thought of how I was going to cope with the plane and coach etc made me think of cancelling, especially as I had to abandon my shopping last week and jump the queue to a disabled loo. That was taking after four Lomotil tablets! I got depressed and my hubby made an appointment with a GP and I saw him this morning. He had no idea that things were as bad, and is on a mission to get me as well as he can and if he can't he will send me to another specialist! Meanwhile he was mortified when I told him how bad things were and how I was going to cancel the holiday. He said he may use some temporary measures to help me have a good holiday, and then once I come back he will try and sort me out.He has made some changes including changing some medications I was on for other things, and he will see me at the beginning of next week to see if I need something else. I now feel hopeful that I may be able to lead a fairly normal life and go out for meals, meet friends etc all without the fear of needing a loo right now. He feels there is something that my insides are reacting to but we have to find it. It could be something that is OK alone but when eaten with something else causes a reaction. He also wonders if I have an infected gut? So is treating me for this just in case to see! I am grateful to his patience and understanding and the fact that he is on a mission to help me. I will let you know how I get on.Update on Carole...Well when I last wrote I was in despair but my GP had given me hope, I thought. We were on the verge of going on holiday and I was ready to cancel, as I permanently need the loo at a moment's notice. My GP gave me some treatment on the Friday when I last got in touch with you.Well the Saturday was not at all great and by Sunday I had a swollen abdomen and was in agony going to the loo - it felt worse than childbirth. I was so swollen I could only wear a nightie and I was unable to sit but had to lie in the fetal position in agony. On Monday I was marginally better. On Tuesday I had an appointment with the GP again, and by then I had given up and was suicidal and unable to walk alone. My long-suffering other half made my GP read my symptom diary and he clasped his hands and said he knew what was wrong. An examination proved I had a bowel blockage, probably caused by all the Lomotil to stop me having diarrhea.I was sent home with some suppositories and Dulcolax (which many folk seem to hate). But what I had to do was cleanse my insides (to put it politely) and get rid of the blockage. I had to see the GP first thing the following morning as well. He said he had contemplated sending me to hospital as things were so bad, only we were going on holiday and he was adamant I was going. The procedure had to be repeated. I admit to taking Imodium to get me to my destination and a few times on holiday and for the journey home.Since then I have gone as long as four days in a row without any medication to try and constipate myself (this is the longest period I have gone in years). Then I have had to take the meds if going out for the day. I have now gone a few days without any meds (although I needed quite a few Friday to Sunday). The result is that I am now constipated and have to go away tomorrow so may well cancel as I would not go out without meds. And I can't take them until I get action so to speak, as once my bowel starts it takes quite a few goes at short notice to the loo to settle. So when going on long journeys I sort of need meds.So far I have been much better than I ever thought I could be but there is still much room for improvement. My husband and kids were amazed at how well I was on holiday, despite having my period which usually makes me much worse. My husband wonders was the improvement due to the copious amounts of water I drank, as I never drink much of anything at home! My diet is now confusing as I have been told so many things I don't know what to believe any more.E-mail Carole:[email protected]",,holiday,husband,appointment,medication,home,myocardial infarction,email,stress,food,newspaper
268,"I have suffered from IBS for 35 years. It started after I had my son in 1974, and I am now 56 years old. I tried Lotronex the first time it was on the market and it made such a difference. My husband is self-employed and we pay our own health insurance which is now over $1,200 per month, and we pay half of of our prescriptions. When Lotronex was pulled off the market I was devastated. It was the only thing that helped and gave me somewhat of a normal life.When going to stores or restaurants I would always ask first where the bathroom was because when I needed to use it I had to go then, and I wouldn't have time to ask where it was. Thank God my husband and now grown kids are understanding. Once the Lotronex came back out I started it again, but since Prometheus Labs bought the prescription they raised the price and it has gone up almost every month since to now being over $1,000 per month. I can no longer afford to take the medicine.We have called the drug company many times just to be told they are working on trying to lower the price - but it continues to go up! I know someone who takes the medicine and only pays $10 per month with their insurance. My Amerihealth is a good plan too - I can't believe that another insurance plan will pick up over $1,000 a month if their patient pays only $10. The drug company don't care about us, just the almighty dollar. My GI has put me on Bentyl which I have been taking for only four days now, but so far it's not working. I have to take Imodium too, and then it will calm down.The mornings are the worst time for me, and for some reason in the summer with the heat. After 35 years I still can't figure it out. If this Bentyl doesn't help within another week, I guess I'll have to try something else until Lotronex becomes affordable - if it ever does. I have to say it worked better the first time - this time I still have bad days and have to take Imodium in addition - but I'll take any help I can get.I always take extra clothes with me, and keep a bucket in my car when traveling. I can't go to dinner with friends at the last minute because I have to have time to load up on the drugs - a sad way to have to live!

When you're crunched up on a chair or in bed with spasms running through your body, nausea kicking at the back of your throat and the feeling that your entire digestive system is about to fall out your body, it's comforting to know I'm not suffering on my own.I was diagnosed with IBS when I was 16, about five and a half years ago. I had a bout of gastroenteritis and from that day the pain came, the constipation, the running to the loo, the feeling of not having emptied your bowels. My parents didn't believe that there was anything wrong and I had my doctor refer me to a specialist who gave me an endoscopy (while I was wide awake - worst experience of my life) and gave me several ultrasounds and a barium enema. Finding nothing wrong with me, he said that I had IBS since my symptoms fit his chart (yes, he had a big blown-up chart on his wall) and from then on I've suffered in relative silence.My partner has seen me in tears with the pain, at home, in shops, in restaurants. It doesn't help that I also have bipolar disorder which already makes me feel completely depressed and I'm also an emetephobe (fear of being sick) so that doesn't help either. All in all, I have the pain five days out of seven, mostly late at night (around 10 or 11 normally) and constipation every now and then. My gut rumbles like it's full of wild curs half the time and the pain is like being stabbed repeatedly (and I've been stabbed so I can liken it to that ha ha).I've found nothing that can help, but alcohol makes it so much worse. Nothing else seems to make it better or worse but eating is like a game of Russian roulette...am I going to be in pain after this or will I have a good day? I have found just one thing that makes the pain slightly better, and that's ice cold water. It acts by numbing your insides. Don't know if it will work for everyone but it's worth popping a couple of bottles in the freezer for an hour before drinking them. It makes the pain more comfortable.

275,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I began to have symptoms of IBS in 7th grade. At that age I thought the noises my body made occasionally during math tests or silent reading time was because I was hungry. I'd never heard bodily noises that sounded like that except for when I was hungry - I didn't know what else to attribute them too.I had always been extremely active, involved, and was always busy with something. Dance since the age of three, soccer since 3rd grade, poms and cheer in middle school, cross-country and track, true camping (not in a camper with a bathroom) multiple times a summer, trips and traveling, sleepovers all the time with my friends. I was very lucky to be healthy enough for all that.In 8th grade I began to get anxious before cross-country races. I don't know if nerves caused my stomach aches, or vice-versa, but either way, I stopped running races. Then my first 'episode' happened. During a weekend soccer game I had such bad pains and cramps that I couldn't stand up, let alone run around and play. Halfway through the game my Dad drove me to the library two minutes from the field, and I spent a very long time with horrible diarrhea. By the time we drove back, the game was over. I told everyone I threw up because diarrhea was too embarrassing.In 9th grade things became unbearable. I had math class the last period of the day, and every day my body made loud gurgling noises because of gas or diarrhea. I couldn't even use the excuse of being hungry because lunch was only two periods before that. During one test I had to go so bad and everyone kept staring because the noises were so frequent - but my teacher wouldn't let me go to the bathroom.I found out that year I had IBS and was also lactose intolerant. This made life horrible, because almost everything I ate needed to be cut from my diet. All through high school my stress increased, partially from trying to hide my IBS, and so my IBS got worse, and the cycle just kept going. At the end of high school, I was no longer running, I stopped playing soccer, I hadn't been to a sleepover since 10th grade, I stopped camping, I only traveled with my family (too embarrassed to use the bathroom if my friends could hear), and I was planning my careers around which ones involved constant silence (where the noises would be noticed) or too much travel where there may not be enough consistency as far as food or bathrooms.I'm now a sophomore in college. I survived my first year living in the dorms because there were only 20 girls sharing our communal bathroom which evens out to be usually one person in there at a time what with classes and activities, and with electric hand dryers, if you pressed the button no-one would hear the gas and diarrhea. It was still extremely embarrassing. I'm in a three-bedroom house now, and I love my two roommates, but am still too embarrassed to tell them. I use the bathroom when they're not here, or turn on the shower so they don't hear my bathroom noises.I'm surviving, but I do miss classes and every day I can't spend as much time in the library as I need to because I'm running to the bathroom at any given time. And although he won't say it, my Dad still thinks it's all in my head. Sometimes I start to think maybe it is just because at least there would be a solution.I'm still planning my life around this. I would love to study abroad, but how can I explain IBS to a host family, or go on weekend trips that may take hours on buses with no bathrooms? I still have those days every few weeks when I'm doubled over in pain, when I'm sitting on the toilet for hours at a time thinking that I would rather be dead than live like this.I'm thankful that I don't have cancer or a disease that will end my life, but living life like this, is it really that much better? I know this is a horrible thought, and I wish I didn't think it, but some days I secretly wish I did have cancer, because at least I could tell people about it, at least people would understand, and if I did die, I wouldn't be in this constant pain and state of distress.E-mail Kelly:[email protected]",,toilet,noise,soccer,class,stratum,stratum,match,pain,body,email
276,"This all started about a year ago when I suffered with stomach acid which seemed to come on after I ate white bread. That suddenly stopped to some degree about five months ago when I became bloated but didn't know what was causing it. Things progressed very quickly to where I was getting diarrhea along with the bloated feeling and occasional stomach acid.I went to the doctors who ruled out gluten intolerance, and I have recently had tests on my liver and kidneys as well as a full blood count (whatever that means). I have two different kinds of tablets I can take, Mintec or Colofac. I find Mintec works better, but I keep forgetting to take it and it repeats if you take it after eating rather than before, and you can't drink on it as it  causes side effects.I find that, when my stomach feels a little off, a glass of red wine works wonders, so I tend to take the Colofac, which doesn't work as well as the Mintec.

It does feel like the worst thing in the world. I would sit and cry in pain, sometimes not being able to look after my daughter as I would like to as a simple park outing would be cut short because mummy needs the loo...again!

I got speaking to the manager who also had IBS. What a relief! Someone who I could relate to. After sharing stories he advised me to try acidophilus capsules, vitamin B and magnesium, along with a change of diet in which I am still finding triggers!So to round things off I will end this by saying wish me luck!

I did not leave my house for three years as I could not face taking my children to school and being trapped in the playground petrified me.I have however had a little confidence boost from passing my driving test which helped and I got myself a job, but lo and behold the IBS is back with a vengeance. I have a meeting at work tomorrow to explain my condition and I had planned to leave, but thanks to all your comments I will now  try and hold out for a few weeks and give Imodium a try again.

283,"I'm 29 and I have had stress-related IBS since I can remember, although I was only diagnosed with it this past year after a series of tests. It wasn't always so bad as a kid, as it really only happened on rare occasions when I was in a really stressful situation. A couple of years ago, life got a lot more stressful, as I think when you get older you just take things more seriously and get stressed much quicker. My job was hell and I was applying to grad school, so needless to say the job, the interviewing process etc got me to a really bad place, and it never went away.I think my base level is pretty high stress, which has caused me to have daily issues with my IBS. Unfortunately, I have a hard time identifying the stress so managing it is hard. I don't feel stressed, but I can tell when I am since I have to rush to the bathroom. I have missed work and  gotten much worse anxiety issues due to wondering whether there are bathrooms around, and how many, and how big the line is, etc. It's so horrible and unless you suffer from it, you really can't understand the mess it can make of your life.The funny thing is, it's not IBS-D or IBS-C or a combo. I don't get either. Mine is just centered around frequency and urgency, but the matter is pretty normal each time. Not sure I get how that is and if that is also considered to be normal for IBS, but that's what I've got. It's a huge pain in the ass - literally and figuratively, and I'm in the process of trying new meds. I did acupuncture, which seemed to help once, and does seem to help a bit while I""m doing it and for that day, but the very next day life is back as normal.I was also told exercise is helpful, which admittedly I haven't done in a very long time and am hoping to start yoga or something again. I tried Hyomax, which for me did nothing, and now I'm trying Librax, which I hope will be more successful. Let's hope something works since I got into grad school, and really don't need this to add to the stress of life.",,job,stress,school,process,toilet,exercise,exam,acupuncture,donkey,ass

They gave me some pain meds, Nexium and lorazepam. A few months later I saw my primary doctor and he gave me a prescription for Donnatal Extentabs which really helped. Last week when I tried to get a refill I found that this med has been discontinued. Now I'm back to hyoscyamine and it is not helping at all! My stomach pains are chronic.

290,"I am 22 and I have suffered with IBS for two years now. The symptoms started whilst I was at university, in my third year. I returned from a girls' holiday in Malia and was diagnosed with a kidney infection, so the doctor gave me antibiotics to cure it. Unfortunately it returned and so more antibiotics were prescribed. This occurred around five times in five months and during this time I began to experience bouts of diarrhea. My first experience of this was after a meal with the girls, after which I came home with chronic diarrhea.At first instance I thought it was due to the rich foods I had eaten, and when the diarrhea bouts began to happen every week I thought it was the antibiotics. However after my kidney infections all cleared up and I stopped the antibiotics I realized the diarrhea and bloating and cramps were getting worse and more frequent. I saw a doctor and he tested for celiac etc but finally determined it was IBS.It was so humiliating to me, I had only been with my boyfriend for a couple of months and after one bad episode staying at his house (which I luckily covered up) I didn't dare stay anymore, which led to me giving unreasonable excuses and caused arguments at first. I started taking Imodium tablets regularly when I was staying at his house or going out with friends or attending university. It made me feel safe as I knew nothing bad could happen.I eventually got the courage up to tell my boyfriend who has been nothing but supportive and understanding, as have my friends. However IBS has changed my life considerably. I used to be a very outgoing person who wanted to go traveling. Now however I have cut back on nights out which I miss and I stock up on usually a whole packet of Imodium if I do go out. I certainly don't dare go traveling anymore.I am just about to complete a masters course and I am dreading getting a full-time job as I don't know how I will cope. At the moment I cope with alternating Imodium, taking two one day and none the next to 'release' everything for want of a better word. However once I have a full-time job this will not work and I fear having diarrhea at work. Also the Imodiums are starting to work less as my body has developed an immunity to them.

I am sad to know that there are so many people with miserable lives caused by IBS, however at least I know I am not the only one with this disgusting situation. I am a 28 year-old lady. I was diagnosed with IBS six years ago. My main problems are occasional diarrhea and terrible stomach noises.Sometime ago I was thinking that I might be able to find a kind of cloth or material that would block the sound, so I could make underwear out of it to cover the stupid damn stomach noises. I searched a lot but could not find anything. Could you imagine how 'normal' life could get if I could just hide my stomach noises?IBS has ruined my life - school, work, friendships, any normal thing that needs interaction with other people. I am too afraid that it will ultimately ruin my family life as well since I cannot really act as a normal wife, accompanying my husband in society). I have turned into a people-phobic person who is afraid of classes, meetings, parties etc. Once I am in a room with people I get super anxious and crazy that my stomach noises will begin at any moment. I start to sweat and tremble and soon the noises begin. I try to control my mind and think about something else but it is just not working. It is an endless loop of misery.I have deeply thought about suicide but I know that it will destroy my parents.

293,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));Thank you for sharing your stories. It truly is wonderful to learn I am not some crazy person with a sour belly. And I wanted to share my story. I was diagnosed with IBS as a teen. I was sick for a full two weeks, laid up in bed, and food just ran through me like water. Afterwards I only had diarrhea once a month. Rarely did I ever have pain, but when I did it was bad but fleeting. I long to have those days back.I had a stressful pregnancy where I almost lost my son twice and had him nine weeks early. After I was told he was healthy (a miracle really), I tried to relax. I went downstairs to the cafe to eat and while chewing, I had this intense, burning sensation in my chest. Well, it slowly got worse. It's been two years and it went from pain and bloating and diarrhea every couple months (in my left side, lower back and pelvic region),  to weeks between bouts, to days. I have good days and bad days, but they easily switch. My left side can get so bad it hurts for days on end before finally going away for a while. Pelvic pain is worse during my period.I was given Buscopan, which I love. The migraines started a few months ago, and they come randomly. I sometimes go a couple weeks, sometimes just a day or two between. I use Tylenol 3 for this but my doctor recently cut down my prescription to test other meds. I hope it helps rather than hinder. And I use Pepto.I haven't had accidents, but I have been caught in public washrooms, and I live on the edge when I go somewhere without extensive planning. I try not to let this consume me. I still make plans, trips and nights out. It sucks to see my mates eating and drinking without worry, but they are understanding. Work is hard when I don't know how the day is going to be. I went on a conference trip with my class in January and basically prayed not to end up too sick. I did get sick on the last day, which in my world made the trip a success as the other days were almost normal. A recent trip to the city to a wedding gown shop was uneventful and I was so thankful for that.I miss being normal and carefree. I only hope one day we will finally find new, better ways to deal with this, or better yet, find a cure. I also hope that my children are spared this grief (neither of my parents or siblings nor my fiancé suffer from this).

298,"Last week I went to Tenerife. On the Tuesday I had cramps and the runs, but I was staying around hotel so I wasn't too worried. On the Thursday I was going on an excursion to Mount Teide...a very high mountain, to watch the sunset and star gaze. On the day of the trip I wanted to foresee any issues, so I took Imodium before I left. Usually when I do this I am constipated for at least 24 hours.We set up off on the trip and stopped at a restaurant for food. So far, so good. However, towards the end of the meal I started to get cramps...this wasn't supposed to happen. I went to the toilet a couple of times but I was constipated, and then just as we were due back on the coach a wave hit me. I managed to get back to the toilet but it wasn't all out, I could tell, and the coach was due to go.I got on the coach, sweating and in some pain, and immediately took some more Imodium. I was willing it to take effect. As we proceeded up the mountain it was obvious that I hadn't passed the crisis. I was in agony. The coach stopped for 50 minutes so we could look at the sunset and have cava, right on top of the mountain, and I knew I couldn't last any longer. It was just a lay-by, no buildings or toilets.I legged it as far as I could and found a rock that I thought no-one else could see me behind, and I had to go...Everyone else was drinking cava and enjoying the sunset, and I was crouched down 200 metres from them in the middle of a mountain. I finished and went back to join them, but a second wave hit immediately and so I went running back to the same place to go again.To say I was embarrassed is an understatement, but I was grateful I didn't do it on the coach (the coach had no toilet either). Ironically, as we set off to a hotel bar (with toilet) the Imodium kicked in and I was OK for the rest of the trip...I was also covered in bruises and cuts as I lost my balance behind the rock, and rocks don't seem to be that comfortable to land on...E-mail Vickie:[email protected]",,coach,car,toilet,mountain,rock,trip,wave,email,hit,cramp
299,"I had my gallbladder removed in August 2013. It had pretty much died and I was in horrible pain. I experienced a wonderful honeymoon period free of pain until December, at which time I started experiencing what I thought was severe acid indigestion. This continued into January at which time I contacted my doctor and she tested me for H-pylori; we were both shocked when it came back normal, as I had had it before and symptoms were identical.At this point she referred me to a GI doctor, the same doctor who removed my gallbladder. He first diagnosed acid reflux and placed me on Nexium which did nothing at all. After a month he had me come back in, inquired about my bowel movements as well as my heartburn and diagnosed me with bile reflux, an over-reactive liver over-producing bile and backing up into my esophagus.He then prescribed another bile-binding medication and Carafate. Honestly, neither of them were working and I was now going on four months of severe heartburn and running to the bathroom four to six times within two hours as soon as I got up in the morning. Regardless of what I ate or drank, it made no difference. I was in extreme heartburn! I go through a bottle of Gaviscon a week, trying to tame the beast within. I find myself cooking for my husband and then trying to find something that won't kill me!I finally had enough of my GI when I called and he prescribed prednisone for a week to no avail. When I called back to tell his nurse that it had no effect and wanted to know what to do, he wanted to try me on another week of prednisone! I fired him and sought a second opinion. Last week I saw a new GI who placed me on Questran three times a day along with my other bile-binding pill and phenobarbital liquid as needed for the extremely horrible heartburn that can feel as bad as a heart attack!My question to anyone out there would be has anyone had these type of symptoms and if so how long did they last and what, if anything helped?

She said really off the cuff ""Well of course you're in pain, of course you need the toilet every five minutes or without any warning, your bile is just leaking into your gut"" like this was common knowledge!I cannot believe there are people out there suffering the same as me, I thought I was all alone in this and even though I wouldn't wish this on anyone, I'm glad there are others.

304,I have had loose stools for about three years. I am now in week three of treatment at a physical therapist specializing in 'pelvic floor therapy'. The pelvic floor therapist uses electrodes to measure results from the daily exercises to firm the muscles in the pelvic floor to control the timing of voiding of loose stools.I can tell I have made progress in three weeks and we have appointments set up for four months; she feels by that time I should be better if this therapy can help. She has also suggested Imodium and my regular MD agreed and I will start Imodium today.

305,"OK, where do I start with this...Well, I have had IBS now for 10 years. It is mainly the constipated and bloated feeling that gets to me most, 
however I feel that I am a textbook case when looking at the symptoms associated with IBS. It is true to say that certain foods do not help, I try my best to find out what they are but behold I am still trying to find the enemy food...I have been to a private dietician and she has said that I am intolerant to wheat and yeast, but looking at labels in shops many if not all foods have either wheat, yeast or both.When I have an attack of IBS I feel totally useless and most of all I feel a total burden on my partner, I constantly complain to him about how I am feeling but I am sure he thinks it's all in my head and that I am obsessed with the issue of my stomach...To be honest with everyone, I would not want my worst enemy to suffer from this awful illness, to me it is an illness, an incurable one.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2']));For those who suffer from IBS I really know what you go through, especially the constipation type. Stress is also a factor and I have also thought that 
hormones also don't help very much as I always find that it is much worse each month after my period has finished...I have missed a lot of work and feel that I will lose my job eventually, it's not a very good one but how many more jobs can I go through because of IBS?eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));I graduated from university two years ago and feel that IBS is a never-ending saga which just creeps up on me when I feel I have finally got a grasp on it.

306,"Well I've been suffering for about 10 years but just recently learned that my condition wasn't normal. It wasn't until I started talking to my friends that I learned you're actually supposed to 'go' once every day and I was suffering from bad constipation. I go once every 7-10 days, maybe longer. Food is my enemy.If I have plans for the night, I try not to eat. I can't stay out very long anymore because my stomach will bloat, and I'll look six months pregnant. My stomach fills to the point that I get shortness of breath. I writhe in pain and nausea. My son, who is three-years-old, is showing signs of IBS also. I just hope it's my over-protectiveness shining through.I finally went to the doctor and he mentioned IBS and as soon as I read some stories, I knew, finally, what was wrong with me. It was such a relief, yet I cried because I know that I have to live with it for the rest of my life.I thought that once I saw a doctor, he'd make everything better and I would finally have a life. No more hiding from my boyfriend because I felt like I was going to pop, no more turning friends down for a night out, and no more telling my boyfriend he couldn't stay the night because I felt sick. How do you explain your utterly embarrassing constipation problem to anyone, never mind your boyfriend? I am so jealous of people who can go to the bathroom, how strange is that?I'm humiliated and scared. I feel like no-one understands. I take laxatives regularly, now I'm switching to enemas in hope of some relief. I can't even be social, because my stomach will make such loud horrible sounds and I'll have to go home to relieve myself of the pressure. Then sit there alone for the rest of the night.I don't even know where to start when it comes to any kind of medicine that will make me feel better.

307,"I was diagnosed with IBS two years ago. First the doctors told me it was gastric acid then they told me that because I was sexually abused I needed counseling and that would make the pain go away. In the last year I have gone for extensive and quite embarrassing tests. In the results of these tests they found a five centimeter cyst on my ovary. Now I thought that was the answer to my pain but it wasn't.In the last three months I have gotten worse. I may have endometriosis. When I eat a piece of toast my abdomen swells up and I look six months pregnant. It is very embarrassing to look big one day and then your stomach flat again, people must think I'm weird.To get rid of this bloating I must eat laxatives and the pain is intolerable.

308,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_4']));I am 27 years old and have suffered with IBS for seven years now. I can relate with many of the previous stories, and am amazed at what the human 
body, mind, and spirit can endure without dying. My irritable bowel syndrome is predominantly constipation, although years ago when I first began having 
attacks, it was always IBS-D ('D' for diarrhea) associated with large quantity, high-fat meals.For the last few years, my symptoms have changed from explosive, unpredictable diarrhea to being constipated at all times. I have experienced both, and honestly one is not any worse than the other for me.With diarrhea, I would always get the relief from having the bowel movement, but the number of movements in one sitting could vary from one to dozens, painful cramps coming in waves before each loose stool. I already had two babies before my first episode, and for me, the pain of abdominal cramps during an episode is so similar to transition labor. It is that intense.Now, experiencing cramps with constipation is totally different. The pain is identical, however I may or may not pass the bowel movement, which sometimes can be absolutely terrifying. Some episodes, while horribly painful, are so common to me that I know I will be OK. I have had about a dozen episodes however where I was sitting on the toilet, cramping horribly, and totally unable to get anything out.My whole body starts sweating profusely, and I have even had the sensation of vibrations in my extremities. I don't know what exactly that is, but it 
probably has to do with a dramatic drop in blood pressure. Just about the time I am ready to scream for my husband to call 911 because I seriously
thought I was going to die, I have a major bowel movement, and although exhausted, I know I am finished, and I feel fine.I went to a doctor about the problem about two years after the onset of symptoms. I was so happy to hear that there was a name for what I was 
experiencing. I was thrilled when he prescribed anti-cramping drugs. I felt like those pills were better than solid gold. I was so happy to have them.Sadly, they did not work, and neither did anything else! I have done the whole diet, exercise, meditation, mind-body connection workshops, etc 
and while I do believe they have provided some benefit, I still have unpredictable episodes that cause so much anguish.Non-sufferers can never understand the fear involved when you feel your first cramp (or whatever the symptom that tells you 'here we go again' happens to be. They don't understand the fear of finding a toilet, and fast The total urgency. For me, the urgency isn't even a matter of having an accident. I haven't yet, and doubt I will while in constipation mode.However, the pain just makes you need to be alone in a locked stall, so you can just sit there and suffer quietly without people looking at you hold your gut and walk doubled over. I know the best bathrooms in every single mall, restaurant, plaza, gas station, etc in the entire city.Thank God my husband is supportive. He has never made comments like the rude ones that are posted on this site. He has sat in many a fast food joint for over an hour while I am doing my thing. My kids are wonderful, also. I can't believe how understanding they are for being only seven and eight. The second I say I'm cramping, they run to get an ice pack for my stomach, ice chips, and wash cloths. I am lucky in that regard.My work life has suffered tremendously, though. I quit my job and am hoping to get disability. I feel like a loser for having to do that, but people just aren't understanding of an employee or co-worker hitting the restroom for an hour at a time, at absolutely any given moment. I was so embarrassed that I never told anyone I was having an attack.Finally I left the job and have stayed home. Not having to stress about attacks at work has really improved the frequency of attacks. Stress=attacks=anxiety=fear=attacks=stress=etc forever. What an ugly cycle this is.

309,"I am a 23-year-old woman just learning how to deal with the IBS with constipation I've experienced since about the age of 13. At that age, I was terrified of being fat like my mom had become and was very vulnerable to images of models with flat stomachs. My IBS with constipation was then characterized by daily gas and bloating, but I thought my problem was that I was getting fat, so I succumbed to unhealthy practices of starvation until my hip bones jutted out and my stomach burned, and later, bulimia.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));I thought I had stomach aches as punishment for eating like a pig, though I was far from overweight.

go out with friends because of the pain and because of the fear they'd see my large stomach and think I was fat.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I put my body and emotions through a lot of torture, and by the time I was 17, I knew I needed to change. I became vegetarian and, at the wonderful 
suggestion of a physician's assistant from India, decided to try treating my stomach aches with yoga rather than all the harsh and useless medicines thrown my way by busy doctors. The yoga did wonders for me in so many ways, especially by relieving the gas and bloating I so loathed.Now my IBS has the added problem of chronic constipation, and I am doing my best to continue my very healthy vegetarian diet despite the days that I wish I never had to eat again. I am also learning how to keep my stomach pains at bay as I am getting into running. My current mileage is between 25 and 30 miles per week, but I think if my stomach weren't so temperamental I would feel more confident running under many circumstances.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I just recently learned about Heather van Vorous' book Eating for IBS which explained the difference between soluble and insoluble fiber - what a difference that knowledge makes! I had always been told to eat more fiber for my constipation and to try a laxative. I have tried every laxative and enema ad, but nothing really works in the long run. I realized that eating probably 50+ grams of fiber per day as I have been for years could actually exacerbate my condition rather than cure it!I hope others will read Eating for IBS and look into the types of fiber in their diet and benefit as I am beginning to. Most importantly, I hope others will 
continue reading and sharing stories to gain a sense of hope in controlling what can too often be such an embarrassing, confusing, and shameful set of 
experiences.My mood has lifted by reading the stories on here and it has helped me to realize that I can find support if I am willing to look or ask.

Another night spent rolling around in agony, another day off work.It will usually start in the early evening or during the night and can go on for as long as 14 hours. The pain is so severe that I just have to lie still and it is so painful that my body seems like it is suffering from shock.

Since having a professor of gastroenterology on the case my gut problems have improved in small increments.

pain and wind, need I say more?eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));Any sufferer knows the scenario all too well. It constantly reminds you of its presence. I have had part of my colon removed and two prolapses hitched up which were believed to be due to a redundant part of my bowel and a slow system, thus frequent straining enforcing weakness hence the prolapse. I now have some incontinence. So I totally understand how difficult and debilitating and stressful this can be for other sufferers.However, despite the bad days, hours and weeks sometimes, there is hope. I have recently been trying Alverine Citrate that has helped ease pain after meals, and I am hoping for a new drug that has yet to be approved by the European health council, hurry up I say! Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for the ops being a success, and having had a fantastic medical team.I'm not working mainly because of this condition, and partly out of choice, but I don't choose or wish this on anybody, having to convince myself and 
explain my anxiety and general behavior to others. I know this is not in my head and is physical alright.Back to positives, I am an avid keep-fit fanatic and over the years found exercise a great help and it certainly brightens my mind, thus giving me a happier frame of mind in all senses of the word. I used to model, mainly swimwear and lingerie, hard to imagine now. One of my glamorous jobs was 
modeling on Japanese TV for Gossard, to the complete opposite, incontinence pant modeling and I was recalled for a re-shoot!I do actually laugh about that one. I do remember thinking poor people having to wear these, little did I know what I had ahead of me. Swimming has 
been the best exercise symptom solver for wind and pain. I have driven to the pool in pain and after 10 lengths it's gone. Do give it a try, I do believe it to be a huge help. It helps open the diaphragm thus helping your breathing, helping the digestion, it helps circulate blood to the gut thus helping aid digestion and you have the soothing massage of the water, so please give it a try it's always been worth the trip.I have managed to not let this condition totally stop every thing I do.

I always used to wonder if I was imagining my symptoms, especially because they do get worse with nerves. I thought that perhaps I was inventing the pain, the weight gain, the cramps, the constipation and the other gory stuff - or at least that it originated in my head.When I was about 23 I realized that I had to have something because this sort of thing couldn't have been completely my imagination. Shortly before I turned 25 I finally got up the courage to go to the doctor, and I was diagnosed - I'm a textbook case, apparently.The doctor put me on Zelnorm, and it has been a miracle for me. What used to be a constant problem is now not nearly as common. However, I still have the old limitations because of the symptoms that inevitably crop up - I don't travel well, and I certainly can't travel with others. I can't stay at other people's houses and I don't like people staying at mine.I quit university once, but am finally working my way through it again (looks like I'll have a BA before I'm 29, at least). It's hard though, and I miss many days when I go through difficult periods. I guess the crux of my anguish is that I can't lead a normal life because I don't know what the next day will be like.

I used to take two charcoal pills from GNC to help with the pain and it was a miracle drug. Unfortunately, it was explained to me that charcoal will also hinder/or knock out other drugs from your system.I'm not sure of the validity of that, but being on Prozac, I didn't want to chance it. The Prozac was for anxiety by the way (OCD symptoms) and that saved my life. So, the charcoal was out, but no problem as the attacks were so seldom.Anyway...a few months ago, several years after the last bout of attacks, suddenly the dang spastic colon starts to act up again. I am so used to it, and it was so infrequent, I never really thought about consulting a doctor about it. That was until about a month ago. All hell broke loose.A few weeks prior to the big nightmare as I call it, after I would eat, I would feel have terrible pains that would only be relieved upon, well, how do I say this gracefully, going number two. And we are not talking smooth sailing here either...we are talking either disgusting diarrhea or even worse terrible constipation.One night...I can't remember what I ate...I started feeling the pain come on.

Well, it didn't relieve the pain.Throughout the whole ordeal of trying to go to the bathroom, I am sweating, cursing, crying, praying...my roommate didn't know what to do. Usually I lock the bathroom door and just suffer the pain but I knew this was different. I gave up trying and decided to lie down on my bed and I was in a fetal position the cramps were so bad.Oh! I forgot the best part. I tell my roommate to go get me the Fleet enema and I tell her to get two as I'm not sure I know how to work those things! Anyway, I read the back and it says to hold the water in for a couple of minutes or something? Um, no. Not going to happen. Needless to say, the enema failed. Finally my roommate says we are going to the hospital now!I really didn't feel like riding in a bumpy pickup truck for miles and miles, especially when I wasn't sure when I would feel that 'knocking on the back door' if you know what I mean. Turns out, it wasn't a worry as I was constipated the whole time in the emergency room.The first ER doc gave me a shot of Demerol. The nurse and my roommate assured me I would be 'feeling no pain' soon. Half an hour later, nothing. No relief from the pain. I was on my side and had just endured an exam where this doc tells me my rectum is 'empty'. You could have fooled me! I told him I was in major pain, and he responded by going off duty.So then another doc comes in and if I have to tell one more hospital staff member my story I am going to freak. Finally...after hours have passed...they give me a dilaudid drip. Ah relief. I have to admit, it was almost worth the pain! Almost but not quite, as I am sure you sufferers can empathize with.So I am high as a kite and go get the obligatory x-rays and all looks fine. The ER doc sends me home with Vicodin...got to love that constipation inducer...and something for nausea. I go to my regular doc and he says he thinks it's IBS. He gave me some Nulev to take before eating and the attacks have since decreased. I also have read up a lot on IBS and constipation, etc. That's how I got to this site.I was so moved by all of your stories I had to share mine.

My office at work is very small and the atmosphere gets very warm, which in turn makes me get all flustered because I don't feel I'm getting any fresh air. Some of my colleagues don't like the window being opened because they get too cold.I have eliminated certain foods that aggravate my tummy, but I still find that I just cannot control the wind.

320,"Well, we'll start with some stats - I am a 35 year-old female. Work full time. Have no financial problems, marital problems, or career problems.August 30, 2003 - my wedding day. The night before my wedding day I did the whole rehearsal dinner thing, went home with my best friend, didn't drink. Went to bed, woke up at 2:00 in the morning with this urge to poop. I did but very little...very little...The next morning when I got up I was a mess. Stomach was in knots, thought I was going to throw up (nerves), oh and this unbelievable urge to pass a bowel movement - and nothing was happening. Got married, did the whole reception thing (still have this feeling like there is a stick up my behind) and that was my wedding day. Well the feeling never went away.Decided to see my family doctor. He said go to a gastroenterologist, and so I went to the gastro and he scheduled a colonoscopy. Had the scope done, came back with nothing wrong. GI doctor put me on Zelnorm and gave me hyoscyamine for the cramps. The hyoscyamine was prescribed for 30-60 minutes before each meal, with the lowest dosage of .0125mg. It made me feel like I was in another world, and didn't make the pain go away.The Zelnorm didn't do anything but give me some gas. Didn't reduce the pain of this feeling like I had to go to the bathroom all the time. Three months later I went back to my family doctor and told him I still didn't feel good - I had these 'cramps' all the time. Going poop would make them go away but only for about 1/2 an hour, then they would slowly creep back.I had this crampy feeling all the time, and this crampy feeling gave me the sensation that my rectum was full and I needed to pass a stool, but 
usually didn't. So my family doctor scheduled some tests - blood work, ultrasound (abdominal/pelvic and intra-vaginal), cat scan, x-ray, small 
bowel series. Went and had all these tests done - negative, nothing wrong inside.Doctors said try a high fiber diet and start using Metamucil. So I started using Metamucil, went to a dietician and learned all about fatty 
foods and what to eat. Now I'll fast forward to the last three months. I never experienced pain that would land me in the ER when I had my period. Well December, January, and February I ended up in the ER getting pumped with morphine and fluids to rehydrate me because the pains were so bad for three days that I wasn't eating or drinking much.My GI doctor put me on a low dose off Zoloft (anti-depressant) because they say that SSRIs raise the pain threshold...Well I was on 50mg and I don't think it has done anything. Over the last four months I have gotten somewhat depressed inside because I always have cramps. I always feel like I have to have a bowel movement, always!

I think when there is no cure for something, the only thing left to do is to turn to others for help and when I found this site I felt like my world just got a little brighter because it helped me feel like I wasn't alone.I'll try to make my story brief, but if anything, I hope that someone can read this and it will help them - like many of the stories did for me - to 
keep waking up every day with the strength to keep on keeping on.When I was young I remember having some issues with eating high-fat meals and then doubling over the next day. It would only come every now and then during gymnastics meets when I would get incredibly nervous. I later went into springboard and platform diving in high school which helped me get into the US Air force Academy and that's where all my troubles started.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I went through basic training the best I could and to put it lightly, it was a hell I will never forget. It was honestly a great experience and I love pushing myself to my limits, but the periods of not being able to eat enough food while getting yelled at, or feeling sick to my stomach because I was so nervous, or the 15-second bathroom breaks, or the lack of sleep for six weeks while missing home and friends so badly is what really kick-started my IBS.I never asked or wanted sympathy for any of what I went through because I had picked that lifestyle. I did however fall into what I call 'poor me syndrome' after I started feeling sick and bloated every single hour of the day without any help and no-one knew what to do. Being a cadet was hard, but for the next three years I suffered in my own personal hell of bloating, cramping, sharp stomach pains, nausea, and not being able to stand for long periods of time (which a cadet is required to do a whole lot) without having to pass out.In the military there is not much specialized medical help and you don't have the time to waste as a cadet being seen by doctors who don't have the time to see you. I want anyone who reads this to take this to heart as much as they can to avoid the situation I got in. Depression is a big side effect of IBS, solely because your whole life changes and you have to revolve your life around this syndrome. Once you have it, there really is no proven way to get rid of it and living with it can be very, very lonely.If anything, this website can be your haven to relate with other people because you are not alone in your suffering. I was just medically disenrolled from the academy after making it through to the first couple months of my senior year and I have nothing left of that experience except: my IBS, an unfinished education, and the strength to go on. I fell into depression at the academy because everybody's life kept going, while I had to lay sick in a cadet room alone and wait until they could let me go home.Trust me. All you have is your sanity, your friends and family, and your strength to get through the hard days. Even though some people may take IBS lightly because most people will say, 'Well, it's not like you're dying or have cancer. You should feel lucky,' but it's still everyday pain you have to live with. It's still a syndrome that most people don't understand, that every breathing moment from when you wake up to when you fall asleep it's there and it's painful and hard to deal with.Please, please, there are people who will listen and help and all you have to do is reach out for help from people who know and live with IBS. Comfort will usually come with sharing your experience and seeking emotional help because as we all know, there is no medication that is a quick-fix.Thank you so much and if anything, I hope I didn't bore you but gave you some hope to keep on keeping on.

323,"I am 21 years old and have been diagnosed with IBS. I have had it ever since I was a tiny girl, maybe three or so. I have never been able to go to the bathroom without a laxative or suppository or enemas, but they never could figure out what was wrong with me until in January it got really bad and I felt like my guts were being burned from the inside out.I have never had a colonoscopy but have been poked and prodded in every way possible. Constantly given more laxatives and saying eat more fiber. I have spent so much money on this I can't even enjoy the money I make since it all goes to medical bills and I can't get insurance now because those companies don't expect to pay for previously diagnosed diseases.Anyway, that isn't important. The doctors gave me Zelnorm to treat it. At first it worked and he gave me Kristalose to help 'wake up' the colon since he said I have a dead colon, but it stopped working. I have lost weight because I am afraid to eat and I weigh 130lbs when I look like I should only weigh around 115, but my stomach is always so full!I can go without a bowel movement for at least two weeks (that is the longest) to a few days. People who can go every day like my boyfriend make me so jealous and I often cry. I don't ever want to go anywhere lately for the fear I might throw up somewhere. I can't even go into a gas station to buy a 7-up because I might have to run into the restroom to throw up. I don't know if that is relevant but it sucks so bad.One thing I have realized through reading everyone's stories is that they have severe abdominal cramps. That is something I don't have! I have burning but no cramps except for my period cramps. So that makes me confused!If anyone has any suggestions on anything it would be great. I also want to say that I feel a little relieved that I have said all this stuff to someone out there that understands.

324,"For the most part I've learned how to eat for my IBS to ease the pain from a 10 (on a scale of one to 10) to a four or five most days. In case it would help anyone else I never touch red meat, lettuce, or fried foods as a rule. I do better when I eat small portions more often rather than three larger meals each day, and lastly I don't eat after 7pm. For me late night eating is worse than any medieval torture I can think of.I started experiencing pain about five or six months after having abdominoplasty. I had had three C-sections and wanted a new stomach (ah, the vain vein). I just assumed at first it was the healing process from the surgery, considering the doctor told me it would take a full year to recover completely. So I naturally thought my pain was related to that.Unfortunately it never got better, it just proceeded to get worse as months and years passed. My mom insisted that I go to my OBGYN. I finally did and guess what, I had very severe endometriosis. He told me I needed a hysterectomy and that once that was done I would have no more pain.So I had the surgery, and I still had the pain. After seeing several different doctors it was concluded that I had IBS. None of the medication I tried worked. I spent tons of money on different types and nothing worked. Thank goodness I work in a place where I can sit in the bathroom for extended periods of time without getting into trouble.Now I take nothing except Perdiem, which helps with the constipation.

three visits over a space of two months to get my doctor to refer me to the local hospital.

My appointment came through in June this year after a six month wait.The consultant has referred for abarium x-rayto confirm the diagnosis, but again he thinks that it is IBS. Good news so far? Well, the waiting list for x-ray is nearly 10 months, followed by waiting another six months for a consultant to see me again. Don't you just love the NHS!In the meantime I am going nuts.

About a year ago I had another surgery on my ovaries which turned out to be nothing. During the surgery the doctor found some endometriosis stage one. I have never thought about IBS being connected to these things until I started reading other stories.I also never thought about it being related to my depression and battles with my self-esteem. After high school I was very ambitious and now I could care less about what I do, except for my three year-old son.

Well, that few days turned into a few weeks, and into a few months. After three months of salmonella, and 20 pounds lighter, I finally achieved a clean bill of health, parasite free.

I suggested IBS to the first one and he just laughed in my face as if I was stupid and said I was too young to get IBS. The second doc was better, and he put me through the usual tests - gastroscopy, CT scan, numerous blood tests etc. I was sent back to the gastroenterologist who did my gastroscopy and he concluded that I have IBS.I have spent the past one and a half years tearing myself apart, wondering what was wrong with me, how no-one can find any physical evidence of a problem, which made everyone say it's all in my head which really got under my skin.

Besides I can't be on my feet for more than a couple of hours in one go without feeling like I'm going to faint and throw up. I am also scared to eat. I love food so much and hate it at the same time.I've got the bloating, gas, nausea, constipation, fatigue, panic attacks. The nausea is the worst because feeling/being sick is my biggest fear. My boyfriend hates sleeping in the same bed as me because if he moves I get woken up and when that happens I'm aware of my stomach hurting and I get angry because all I want to do is sleep.The best time of the day for me is mid-morning. I can't eat breakfast because I can't stomach anything so early, so mid-morning I can eat light things like biscuits and fruit. My boss thinks I'm an unhealthy cookie monster because he always sees me eating cookies. Pity he can't understand that I only eat lots of cookies because that's one thing that doesn't make me feel sick. I still get the gas after eating them but it's the only time the symptoms are the most minimal.There are some days where I feel pretty good (still have gas though) and there are some days where the only time I don't feel sick is when I feel hungry. My stomach is growling, so I eat something and then the vicious circle starts again. Sometimes I go to sleep feeling sick, then have horrible dreams and wake up feeling sick. I've lost two dress sizes in weight and people think I'm on drugs or have an eating disorder. People say 'Oh, IBS is common' like the common cold. Little do they know how it affects people.I feel so relieved that I now know what is wrong with me, yet at the same time I'm so depressed because all I can do is try to ease the unpredictable 
symptoms and hope that one day it will all just go away. I've only had it for 18 months and I already feel like I'm about to fall apart.

can eat and what I can't. Still to this day I am finding new things to eliminate. I have been on medication every day. I feel that I am totally dependent on these meds to live my life.My story is hating the bathroom, I feel it is my torture room. My IBS acts up between 2:00am and 5:00am, so I am completely exhausted when I go to work then I have no energy to exercise due to my run-down condition. My episodes last from one to three hours. And when I have a very bad attack it lasts three days and then I start bleeding.I spent three weeks in the hospital so they could find out why I was bleeding and they told me it could have been a polyp, wrong! I just had a look over by the doctor and I was clean. The only thing the hospital did not do was go into my small intestine, they just let me go with meds.I have been in so much pain, I have to change my pajamas, they are soaked with sweat from the pain. I also on occasions passed out on the floor due to the pain. So how do I make my bathroom a nice place to go instead of a torture chamber?

337,"I am so grateful I have found this site! I hear a lot of people say they have IBS, but they really have no idea what it's about, or how much someone who has real IBS is suffering. Mine started about two years ago. I was going through several 'life changes' all at once when my symptoms began. I know that IBS doesn't just rear its ugly head during times of stress, and that the stress doesn't have to be bad stress, this is just when my symptoms presented themselves for the first time.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));It began with the birth of my first grandchild, which next to giving birth to my own children was the most wonderful experience of my life. The day before she was born my father-in-law died unexpectedly. Then I went to planning a wedding for my daughter - if any of you have ever done this, you know that such a beautiful thing can make you crazy on more levels than you ever thought you could achieve!eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));During this time, my husband and I began to make plans to move from our home (a suburb of Atlanta) to his hometown in the mountains. We began the process of selling one house while simultaneously buying a new one. Also during this time I got a call from my Dad telling me that for the first time in his 62 years he was to be admitted to the hospital for a procedure to increase circulation in his legs - not a minor thing, but not a heart bypass either.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));About two weeks later we found out that he had lung cancer, and the procedure he had had caused it to spread very quickly. He only lived about eight weeks after the original procedure was done. My husband and I moved, and a week later my daughter got married. I forgot to mention that I was matron of honor, as well as mother of the bride, and I was very ill on my daughter's wedding day. I was also very ill during my dad's funeral.Since then I have struggled off and on with my IBS. I have seen at least 10 doctors who all say the same thing. I finally found a doctor who actually has IBS, so that was a blessing. He prescribed Lexapro (for anxiety) and another drug, the generic form is called Hyoscyamine, which helps me to be able to eat as I go days at a time without being able to eat anything.Usually I can control my IBS with Mylanta maximum strength and/or Gas-X, but this week I have had the worst bout of IBS ever. I have been in bed most of the week, with pain that I could compare to childbirth, plus vomiting. I've been unable to eat at all, and now everything has broken loose and the diarrhea has begun.I haven't been able to work, I've had to cancel most of my appointments this week, and it's impossible to get people to understand that this thing is always there lurking, and you never know when or where it's going to strike. It's not something that runs its course then goes away.Today I feel better. I was actually able to venture out and go to my office, but I'll only stay half the day, as I feel very weak and tired. Yesterday the pain got so bad I thought seriously about going to the local emergency room. I was crying and begging God to just let me have a few minutes without this excruciating pain. Finally after several hours it subsided, but I was so weak I couldn't get out of bed for more than a few minutes, and I couldn't walk from one end of my house to the other.I am fortunate to be self-employed - I had a regular job when the IBS first started but I was out sick so much that I was fired. So now I have work where I control the hours I work, but I still have clients to see, and I don't like to break commitments to them, it's bad business. I'm thinking of moving out of my office and go back to working from home because it would just be easier.I am the type of person who needs to be busy, I am very active and the thought of being homebound or having to stay in bed for days or hours at a time is just depressing. Anyway, don't mean to feel sorry for myself, I'm just thankful that I found this site, and maybe through it I can find different ways to treat and cope with IBS.E-mail Lori:[email protected]",,home,pain,stress,bed,people,email,job,doctor,doctor,father

339,"I am 24 years old and I experience severe ongoing constipation. It started when I began taking a colon cleansing supplement I saw on TV. I 
always thought this was a safe thing to do. What happened was that the pills ended up stripping the walls of my colon. I had a colonoscopy done and found out my peristaltic movement was basically non-existent.My body is so used to taking laxatives that I can't function normally without them. My doctor gave me Zelnorm, but to be honest I think this medicine is just another pat-me-on-the-back drug to shut me up and appease me. No-one seems to be having any results with this drug and no-one seems to be getting any real answers or solutions.I feel everyone's pain who suffers like this. I don't know how to wean my body off of laxatives because I have no bowel movement without them, and I get really sick, bloated and crampy when I can't have a bowel movement.I would like to share a suggestion I heard. My mom's friend had this and went to a chiropractor and it completely helped her. I suppose the nerves in the back are connected to the nerves in the colon somehow and it stimulates activity down there. I am going to go see one soon. Also I heard an acupuncturist was good for stimulating all the areas of the body that have basically gone to sleep (like the colon).My mom had stomach problems for years with cramping (not sure if it was IBS) and she cured herself by not drinking soda/pop and taking coral calcium - she calls it the fountain of youth, but it helped her tremendously.I am just glad to know that I am not alone, because when I sit on the toilet (forever) in tears because of being constipated I feel depressed, alone and helpless.

341,"I am a 25 year-old with a five year-old son. Today is a good day so I am taking advantage of the fact that I am not in my bed clutching my stomach in pain, nor on my way to the hospital yet again throwing my guts up.

So I lie in bed or on the floor feeling as if there is a knife scraping my insides out and retching up foul-tasting fluids until I am completely dehydrated and have to take another trip to the hospital for fluids, pain medication, and Zofram or one of the many anti-nausea medications they feed me through tubes.

344,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I am a 46 year-old woman, wife and mother of two wonderful boys. I was diagnosed with IBS in 2000 (had barium enema test - would rather give birth to triplets) after several years of suffering from constant constipation, anxiety and depression. I had a hysterectomy in 1997 after having repeated problems with pre-cancerous conditions on my cervix and I also had a condition called adnomiosis, which is endometriosis in your uterus. I had my uterus and cervix removed during the surgery, but since my ovaries were OK, my doctor left those alone.My IBS has been relatively dormant for the past four years. As long as I take extra fiber, watch my diet, don't drink alcohol, watch my caffeine, etc I have some episodes, but nothing like many people have described on this site - heart-wrenching stories - especially the young girls, my heart really goes out to you brave women.Two years ago I started going through early menopause. I had no idea I would long for the days when I just felt crappy and exhausted all the time. I have had every possible symptom associated with menopause and was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Thousands of dollars, trips to the ER, trips to endocrinologists, acupuncturists, naturopaths, anti-depressants, you name it, and two years later my menopausal symptoms and my thyroid symptoms are somewhat better, but guess what's back with a vengeance?The constipation, bloating, gas, then sometimes (if I am lucky) alternating diarrhea is totally unmanageable. Nothing that worked in the past 
is helping. My doctor put me on Zelnorm - that is just nothing more than a laxative and made my anxiety flare up. I just tried peppermint oil, that has helped slightly and I've upped my probiotics temporarily just trying to get stabilized so I can go out in public. I also just started on primrose oil, which is supposed to help menopause as well. I can't really go to my yoga classes right now and I depend on those to manage my stress level.I was just wondering if there are any other women out there that are experiencing an increase or return of IBS symptoms and are in menopause or know of other hormonal links - I know there have been documented issues with menstrual cycles and pregnancy. Could it be any fluctuation in hormones? I haven't found any other sites that have discussed any connection with an increase in IBS symptoms and menopause.

345,"To begin with, before I share my sordid story, I am Australian and was hoping that there may be a few others here. If this is the case, wonderful! Let us try to help one another. I am 33, happily married, I have one almost three year-old son and I do not work (due to not being able to). My symptoms began when I was 17 and have gotten progressively worse in the 16 years since. I have seen in excess of 50 doctors and three gastroenterologists. All except for one of the doctors has treated me as if I were a hypochondriac, and one of the gastroenterologist, without even examining me, told me that he could not help, that I should see a psychologist!eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2']));The one doctor who has shown some sympathetic belief in my illness also found a brain tumour which had gone undiagnosed for (probably) all of my life. So right now, though I am feeling terribly lucky to have discovered this and receive treatment, including surgery, I am also becoming more and more depressed by the IBS.Post-surgery I have suffered with a golden staff infection that has been hanging on now for five weeks (surgery was only seven weeks ago) and I have been on penicillin for all of this time. Needless to say, the combination of infection and strong antibiotics is not helping the IBS at all!My most debilitating symptom with the IBS (which was diagnosed 13 years ago when there was little information about treatment available, and what was available left a lot to be desired) is nausea. It has completely taken over my life and controls my every thought and action. I do also suffer with extreme constipation and alternating explosive, foul diarrhea accompanied by the same agonizing pain that everybody else here has the pleasure of knowing. I too have been hospitalized with it on a couple of occasions.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));It usually gets me at about four o'clock in the morning, and I then too spend hours writhing until the movement occurs, at which time I do indeed sometimes feel that it all may end right there on the toilet. But, inevitably, once the bowel is clear, I am exhausted, but OK for a couple of days until the process all begins again. I am also now beginning to experience pain after eating in the upper abdomen and, like many others here, cannot eat past about 6.30pm.I also can feel OK during the day and then like clockwork, at 4.00pm everything starts to go haywire. The nausea begins and by dinnertime I can barely eat, if at all. I have been trying to force food in and sometimes it helps a little, but it certainly makes for a non-existent social life.I have also become (seemingly) intolerant to almost all foods and live now on chicken, lettuce, small amounts of bread and potato, carrots and peas. That is IT! After the birth of my son it all became worse, and is always worse during my period. But I lost 35kg in about 14 weeks after my son was born, because not only was I breast-feeding but I also couldn't eat. I have not been able to put any of the weight back on and am therefore also incredibly lethargic.But it is the nausea that I am finding it most difficult to live with. I now fear leaving the house because it can hit me at any time out of nowhere, and though I do everything in my power not to throw up (have developed an insane phobia of doing so and so live each moment in a state of anxious fear) I never know when I am going to feel like I might.Sorry all, I really could go on here for pages and pages, but was ultimately hoping that others may have some suggestions and that there may

anti-depressants, a low dose of amitriptyline, and I took that with amazing results. I was having a bowel movement once a day for a year. I felt fine and was in great shape.Then my doctor changed. This was two years ago now and I have been struggling. They insisted that I come off the amitriptyline which I had to do myself, and since then I have been worse than ever. I did come off the amitriptyline, but it was a struggle because the symptoms got worse, and when you know something can help it is difficult on your own to try to come off it.I am now worse than I have ever been. I see a homeopath and no matter what he seems to give me I am getting worse. I suffer now with chronic constipation with soft clay-like stools that are difficult to pass and are covered in mucus. I am also seeing a dietician and that seemed to help, but now I am not so sure as I am on this elimination diet and I am still suffering from the clay-like stools and constipation. Re-introducing food is difficult because I am always constipated so how can I tell if the symptoms are getting worse?The worst bout of IBS has been in the last two weeks. It got so bad that I had to go to the doctor because I was so constipated, despite using Dulcolax, pessaries and also enemas, that I could not breathe. I had to visit my doctor in an emergency and he gave me some Picolax, the stuff they use before a colonoscopy. This cleaned me out completely and I felt fantastic for a day.I am now back trying to pass these soft mucus-covered slimy stools that are impossible. I have been unable to exercise recently as I have got so bad with the IBS that I just wanted to curl up and die at times. I have been known to break down and cry, although most people don't see it. I rarely take time off work because I try not to let this affect my life, but it really does.People say I am strong for coping with this but I don't feel it. It ruined in part my last relationship and I shy away from relationships, even 
though I would like one, because of this. I don't know about anyone else but I have a really crap sex life because of this as well. I even hate food 
because the way that I look at it is...if I don't eat it, it cannot get into my bowel and cause me problems. I am getting skinnier by the day and for a 
tall girl at 5' 11' it is not a good thing. My family are always on my case about that.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I would love to have just one month without any symptoms - it would be fantastic. At the moment it is day in day out with no let up. I am very depressed about it and I don't see any way out. I am also going to see another specialist and having more tests done because the other hospital failed me. My current doctor took an x-ray and showed me that my bowel was not emptying as it should do. I felt like saying...well duh...I already know this.Now they are sending me for another test where I have to swallow a pill and they do a test to see how quickly the food passes through my system. I am not sure how that is going to help or when they will get around to seeing me as it all takes so long.Currently I am taking psyllium husk capsules, magnesium and vitamin B. On top of that I am a regular user of Dulcolax and suppositories. Nothing seems to be working and I cannot have another attack like the last one, as the breathing thing scared the life out of me. I wanted to go on holiday this year but I am terrified about going. The last attack which is still going on was just so horrid. I don't know how long my body had been holding the food to get that bad.All day long I seem to have this uncomfortable feeling in my bowel and not the slightest thing I do can relieve it. I am very worried about 
becoming reliant on laxatives. But more so I am worried about cancer, as it is in my family. The worst bit is explaining it to the doctors because they see constipation as a problem passing hard stools. I don't have that issue, mine is passing soft greasy stools. So all they give me is stuff to soften it further. It is a nightmare.I know that my body is capable of going to the toilet normally as I occasionally have a bowel movement like everyone else, but I am getting to the end of my rope on this one. I hate my body and I hate myself. I long for the days of the amitriptyline which helped and I want some form of a life again. I am only young and I hate being like this. I want to have normal relationships and enjoy sex and feel confident in myself but at the moment that seems like a distant dream.I am now resorting to extreme exercise as a way to get my sluggish bowels moving. I am going back to kick-boxing this week in the vain attempt that the severity of the exercise might help. It used to but that was when I was on the anti-depressants. Sometimes it does involve being kicked in the stomach but to be honest that is nothing in comparison to the pain that the IBS gives me. Also it is a way of forgetting for one hour a week as it is good fun. I just hope that it does not mean that I get any skinnier otherwise I really will be in trouble.E-mail Priscilla:[email protected]",,doctor,doctor,food,body,exam,constipation,email,attack,attack,attack
351,"I am only 22 years old and I have been suffering from IBS for nearly a year. It doesn't sound very long at all once you read all the other stories 
about people who have suffered from it for years. Well, here is my story...It all started the morning after I had finished a busy night shift at work. I had this excruciating pain in my stomach. My fiance was quite concerned. I was exhausted anyway and just went to bed for most of the day. Two days later we had just finished Sunday lunch and were settling on the settee to watch a DVD when the same pain came back, this time much worse, and I couldn't actually get up from the settee. As I work in the operating theater I 
assumed the worse, all manner of things were going through my mind, including the possibility that I had got appendicitis.My fiance took me to A+E. A doctor said I had a bladder infection and sent me on my way with antibiotics. I continued taking the antibiotics for a 
couple of days but had no respite from the pain, I just couldn't go to work. I went to my Mum's house for some company. I felt, weak, lethargic and sick. 
My mum was very concerned and I was virtually carried into the doctor's surgery.The doctor was also very concerned and immediately admitted me into hospital, but with another diagnosis - this time the doctor thought I might 
have a twisted ovarian cyst. I knew if that was the case that I would have to have emergency surgery. I can't describe how I felt when I heard the 
news, I was so frightened. At the hospital I was given an ultrasound scan which didn't show anything. I was relieved but also anxious - what could 
this pain possibly be? I was discharged from the hospital with strong painkillers.I went back to work a couple of days later, when the pain had slightly subsided. An hour or two into my shift I was doubled over in pain. One of my 
colleagues took me down to A+E (one of the perks of my job), where a blood test and urine samples came back negative, and I also most embarrassingly 
had a rectal exam (this was to detect if I had been suffering from a rumbling appendix). The test was normal and I was sent home.This time a couple of weeks went past, and I was getting ready for an afternoon shift at work when I collapsed in my kitchen with the pain. I was 
so worried, it definitely couldn't be my appendix now, and I was expecting the worst. I was rushed into A+E again, this time by ambulance, and the 
doctors decided to do a CT scan. I had to have a barium meal, which was absolutely revolting - it was a chalky liquid and I had to drink a litre 
within two hours. My fiance was very supportive and stood by me all the way. The CT scan came back negative.One of the consultants came to see me and decided that they would perform a laparoscopy (an operation where a camera is inserted into an incision 
underneath your belly button to look around your abdomen). I was very anxious as even though I have seen these operations hundreds of times I had 
never been under the knife myself.The next couple of days before the operation I was allowed to go home. I remember it vividly because it was around Halloween and I was supposed to be having a party for my family. The party went ahead because my fiance thought it would take my mind off things. He prepared everything and the evening was fun but I couldn't stop thinking about the operation.I had the operation, and they found nothing. Even though I was relieved I felt like I had some sort of phantom illness. Again weeks passed without 
having the pain, I went back to work and even went through the whole of Christmas without suffering. I thought it was just one of those things 
because apparently it is very common for women of my age to suffer with certain pains without any definite cause, and they will eventually subside.In February this year the pain came back. I went back to my GP who had a very long chat with me, was I stressed or worried about anything, was there any history of bowel conditions in the family? These were all questions I had never contemplated. Yes I was very stressed, I was newly qualified in my job and getting the longest and most unsociable shifts, I was planning a wedding for July this year and my Mum and Uncle suffer badly from IBS. I 
couldn't believe nobody had suggested it before.Another thing was I suffer very badly from constipation. I can go to the toilet every day but hardly anything will pass at all. Because I had been 
like this for a number of years, probably since I was 15, I thought it was normal. The doctor prescribed Lactulose and the anti-spasmodic mebeverine 
for the pain. I took it regularly for a few weeks but to no avail. Eventually the GP referred me to a specialist.I went to see the specialist, and he said straightaway that I didn't need a colonoscopy. As I am quite a curvy woman (size 18-20), when he examined me he said I had a condition with a fancy name, which basically meant I had a trapped nerve because he thought I was overweight. He put a local 
anaesthetic into the area where I suffered the pain the most. He said that if I had no pain when I stood up he had cured the problem. How was I 
supposed to know? I hadn't had the pain for a week!The next few weeks I went on a diet, I thought anything was worth a shot. I lost nearly a stone very sensibly following a well-known diet, again to no 
avail. The same pattern followed, straight to the GP surgery and admitted again onto a ward for observation. I was feeling very depressed at this 
point, I had a mystery illness, I had been off sick for the past two and a half months and I was supposed to be getting married in a matter of weeks. 
My entire family, work colleagues and especially my fiance were extremely supportive, and I don't know what I would have done if it weren't for them.Eventually I went back to see a different specialist who diagnosed it as IBS. Finally after all those tests and hospital visits I have an answer. I 
can't explain why I felt so relieved, I suppose I kept thinking that people thought I was making it up, I was very embarrassed when I was waiting to see 
the doctor, I had seen nearly every doctor that worked in the surgery.Another fear was of losing my job, which is very demanding with very mixed hours from one week to the next. I am still scared because now if I 
catch the flu or a cold I will be petrified of taking the time off.I got married about three weeks ago and we went to New York for our honeymoon. I did not suffer from the pain at all, all the stress had 
disappeared and I am so happy. I would like to say I lived happily ever after, but here I am writing this story because I am off sick again. I only 
went back to work for a week and a half and I'm off again. This time I have an ear abscess (extremely painful), but I was ready to go back to work this 
morning until I got my stomach cramps. I think this is due to my antibiotics but I am sitting here with a very bloated stomach and feeling sorry for 
myself once again.It is something I will have to live with for probably the rest of my life. I have got to learn to cope, but being so new to the illness I haven't 
found a way yet. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.E-mail Jenny:[email protected]",,pain,doctor,doctor,job,boyfriend,fiancé,operation,tale,exam,surgery
352,"I'm 24, currently at university, and I have IBS. God that makes me sound like I've started AA or something, but it does feel like we're part of an 
exclusive club that not many people know about. I've had IBS for three years now. It came on quite suddenly I think. I'd never really taken any notice of things like that before, I just took it for granted that I could go for a week without going to the toilet, I thought that was normal! My mum tells me I've always been fairly constipated as I was a small baby and two weeks late and didn't take much feed. I've grown up with a small appetite and have hardly ever been hungry. Even now I'm still tiny, five foot, but as each day goes by the amount I eat gets smaller and smaller.I wake up every morning feeling queasy and go to bed feeling exactly the same, my life is one long nauseous existence. I don't eat greasy food, fast 
food, in fact I hardly eat any food as I feel constantly sick. Doctors just keep giving me tablets for stomach ulcers, acid indigestion, anything really, but nothing works. I'm tired of feeling like this, I want to go out and have a meal, something I've never been able to do.Part of why I hate the IBS so much is because I already have a phobia of sickness resulting from an incident when I was four and was very ill one 
night, and I'm constantly battling with myself to eat. I have to force myself to eat though the thought of it just makes me feel worse. I'm not anorexic, far from it, as I love biscuits, ice cream, bread, all the bad things, but I know that if I don't eat I will be even more ill.It's a vicious cycle though, as the less I eat the worse I feel, and the worse I feel the less I want to eat. Sometimes I've just wanted to go into 
hospital and be drip fed as that way I can get the vitamins I need without me having to swallow anything and feel ill.Another thing that has suffered because of the IBS is my social life. I don't go out much anyway as I don't drink (another part of the sickness 
phobia), and because everyone else does I get bored quickly. But I can guarantee that when I do go out I'll have an attack. This is in the form of 
severe stomach cramps, the need to go to the toilet frequently, and worst of all wind that is so bad even my eyes water, and we all know you can normally 
tolerate your own!In fact the wind is one of the worst parts for me as I can't stop it from happening because I'll end up with stomach ache, but I can't let it out as 
it's too embarrassing. It's resulted in many nights in on my own, and as a student this can lead to people thinking you're unsociable, boring, geeky 
etc when it's not my fault, but I can't tell anyone as it's disgusting, who wants to discuss bowel movements when you can go out, get drunk and pull!Anyway I'm resigned to the fact that I'm stuck with this for the rest of my life, but each day it gets slightly worse. I'm tired of feeling so sick all the time, I want someone to wave a magic wand and make me better again, but I know that's never going to happen.The worst part is the fact that doctors just dismiss my symptoms when I've gone in and said how sick I feel and how depressed and tired I am. They 
just say 'It's all part of IBS' and prescribe some more stupid pills that won't work. If anyone can help me I'd really appreciate it, I know my symptoms aren't as severe as some people's but we all suffer in our individual ways and only us, the sufferers, know how life-consuming this is.

353,"I am 30 years old and I was diagnosed with IBS at 16. I had just completed my GCSE exams and suffered with severe cramps followed by diarrhea every other day for two weeks. I had never had this before, and after listening to the physical symptoms my GP enquired about any recent stressful events. She diagnosed IBS arising from the stress of exams and I was put on Colofac.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));From what I remember the tablets worked but I have suffered regularly over the years. And up until this week, I have learnt to expect the cramps after the evening meal (not in the morning, always in the late afternoon or evening) and then explosive diarrhea involving several trips to the toilet until my bowels feel empty.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));This week, however, I am experiencing different symptoms - of constipation and painful bloating and trapped wind. I can feel the wind moving in my intestines and I feel like I am about to have diarrhea but then I just pass mucus and wind and no poo. I am fed up, bloated, uncomfortable, sluggish and miserable. I have suffered with the mind-numbing, all-consuming abdominal pains and diarrhea most of my adult life and to discover that there are now more 'treats' in store for me is just depressing...I have managed to sort of control the spasms by taking Colofac in order to control bad flare-ups, and thought I had found a light at the end of the tunnel when I was told about the benefits of Muller Vitality yogurts and drinks.

IBS is horrendous and I am so disheartened at the thought that I now have extra symptoms to cope with and try to control as best I can. I am off to the chemist tomorrow to get some Senokot for the first time and I just have to hope it works for me. As a result I am having to miss work and a planned social event.I think for me, the unpredictable nature of when IBS attacks will occur and how bad they will be causes me the most stress. And now I am faced with more uncertainty about the symptoms I can expect to experience. My family, boyfriend, and close friends are brilliant though and never ever fail to be any less than supportive and sympathetic, but considering how many people out there suffer with IBS, I don't personally know anyone with this condition.

354,"I am a 30 year-old single parent with one child. My mom came down to 'assist' me after I asked my daughter's father to leave our home before my daughter turned one. I can definitely relate to the frustration everyone here feels when people get on the 'It's all in your head' soap box.In addition to my IBS ailments, I am also a long time anxiety disorder sufferer. I was diagnosed the summer before I went to college by a 
psychologist my mother dragged me to because she thought that I was a malingerer who complained about stomach problems to get out of doing things. Turned out, my psychologist (and all of them since) have been more interested in talking to her than to me!I now have to live daily with a person who thinks IBS and my anxiety is like the flu and will go away. I have food tested to great lengths over the years and despite being lactose intolerant, have ended up becoming a lacto-ovo vegetarian with minor success, aside from stressful living arrangements/predicaments.As a child, I was made to feel that needing to stop and use the bathroom was an unwelcome interruption. Requests were met with 'Now? Right now?', 'Can't you wait?', 'You should have gone before we pulled off' and other various expletives conveying her level of annoyance. Thank God no super-embarrassing events ever happened. But I became quite adept at finding where the restrooms were in just about any establishment I visited! Then after 'disappearing' I would get it for scaring her half to death. It was and still is well worth hearing her mouth.My point of sharing my story is not just to commiserate about how bad IBS is. Parents of potty-training children: think about how you go about this process. Be mindful not to show or voice your annoyance about ill-timed bathroom breaks. The reason for the disapproval is not evident to a two or three year-old. All they learn is that 'If I tell them I have to go potty they will not be happy with me'.Take care with your words and actions. (Read up on bowel withholding and Freud if you don't believe me.)

356,"I'm 24 years old and live in the UK. I was diagnosed with IBS about a year ago. I would maybe get an attack of diarrhea once a month. The pains were like labor pains and really hurt. I had to quit my job because I would worry that I would get an attack at work, then the worrying would set it 
off. It's a vicious circle!About four weeks ago I discovered that I was pregnant. Unfortunately I later had a miscarriage. Since that day my IBS has taken a turn for the worse.

Because of it I start getting constipation and at the same time get a bad low backache. The pain is so severe that I can't walk properly.I can hardly do anything during those days. If I take Meteospasmyl, after a few days the intestine relaxes and the backache and the constipation go away. I talked to my doctor about it and he says that it is possible to get low backache as a result of IBS but it's rare.

359,"I've suffered with IBS since I was about 17 or 18. To start with it was an even mix of constipation and diarrhea. I was usually constipated, but once it got going it wouldn't stop! I kept quiet about it for years, suffering silently, until four years on my mother forced me to go to the 
doctor. He shouted at me, told me to eat more roughage and drink plenty of water.I tried to explain that nobody could eat more roughage or drink more water than I already did, but he refused to listen and prescribed Normacol and Fybogel. Both of these made me worse, so he then prescribed laxatives (senna). He told me to take these for over a month. I did so thinking the doctor knew best, but of course these made me worse than I had ever been. I now strongly believe his suggestions have made me more ill in the long term.Eventually I was referred for various tests (endoscopies, ultrasounds etc) eventually being diagnosed with IBS, given Buscopan and more Fybogel despite these not working before. I feel that IBS has ruined my life. Reading Sophie's story was like reading about myself. I identified with everything!

I barely earn enough to pay for my special dietary foods, supplements and treatments. I'm lucky that I have parents who allow me to live with them rent-free, but I do not know how long this can go on because they are getting sick of me and they do not understand at all the seriousness of this or the pain I am in. They constantly complain about my excessive toilet paper consumption but refuse to believe that I cannot go unless I wipe first with a warm wet wad of toilet paper, and when I do go it's a stop-start process that makes a lot of mess and therefore requires a lot of toilet paper!Another thing this is affecting is my relationship with my boyfriend. We have been together for just over a year, and at first I thought he'd 
understand my problems because he had serious digestive problems when he was about 14 which then disappeared after a year or so. But he does not, and if we go away I worry about my toilet problems. I need to sit on the toilet for about 45 minutes to be comfortable for the rest of the day, but I feel too embarrassed to do this when he's around.On occasions when he has visited I have been so constipated and in so much pain that we cannot go out or do anything. I cannot go for weekends away with him because I am afraid to upset my routine. I have missed out on a lot; holidays, days out, a career!The thing that has been most helpful was changing my diet, taking valerian supplements and large doses of fennel. I cut out dairy, wheat, 
sugar, yeast, caffeine, potatoes, white grapes, green and red peppers, fried foods and alcohol to mention a few. I managed this for about six months but it was impossible to live like this, and although my symptoms were greatly alleviated I was still constipated and had to get up almost four hours before I had to leave the house to fit in my routine. That meant a 5am wake for a job that started at 9am, and even then I would only just make it.I would then have to rush home before 6pm to eat my dinner - if I ate it any later than this then I'd have to add another hour onto my morning 
routine. I had no social life and was very depressed. I still am, although now I have a bit more of a social life because I work evenings only, so I 
can go out to eat with friends and then spend the rest of the day on the toilet before work.I envy people who can go out, eat pizza, and then go to work the next morning.

363,"Well, the last 17 months have been hell. All the health professionals think I'm mad. My GP told me to pull myself together! I am a single mum of two children, who have watched helplessly as I crawl out of bed clutching my stomach, vomiting uncontrollably. The endless array of symptoms: constipation, vomiting, pains in both legs, severe lower back pain, continuous stomach cramps. The list goes on.I have gone to accident and emergency on countless occasions - once in an ambulance! It began when I miscarried. After that all my symptoms followed my period - guess what they investigated me for - endometriosis. The GP decided I had gynecological problems, even though on one of my visits to A and E the consultant said I had IBS! Then a pelvic scan, all OK. Then a sigmoid flex, nothing again.While this all went on everything in my life was going wrong, falling apart. My life was based on going to the doctors and begging them to see I had a severe illness! I am on the verge of losing my job which I love. My employers cannot tolerate my poor attendance due to my IBS. My eldest daughter is on anti-depressants and my youngest is now a mini me!Finally yesterday I had a colonoscopy. I prayed the night before that they would say 'Hey, you have Crohn's or bowel cancer'. Anything other than IBS - sad but my life is a mess because of this illness in all senses. I'm lucky that I have a wonderful partner (who I don't live with). He has supported me throughout, he found this site. It is frustrating - no, it's heartbreaking.

364,"I was finally told I have IBS two years ago by a gastro doctor. I knew before I went through a long list of procedures, from two upper GI tract evaluations to lower GI tract evaluations that I had IBS with constipation. I've had it all my life.I'm 34 and now I'm dealing with depression, weight gain, and no pain meds to make the horrible cramping/pain go away. Zelnorm was taken off the shelf and now my eight-year-old daughter has it too. I do not want her to go through the same pain I went through. If anyone knows how/what to give children to help with the pain and constipation please let me know. I've taken her to the doctor and they gave her a powder that gets mixed with drinks, but it doesn't seem to help much.I'm in the military and luckily I've made it to 15 years, but with the weight gain and stomach pain, I'm losing a battle to make 20 years of 
service so that I may retire. I'm frustrated with the military doctors and the excuses they give me (don't eat this/that, exercise, drink lots of 
water, eat lots of fiber), it gets old. They gave me a lifetime supply of Colace for a solution!I've taken the best measures I know of and decided to have a tummy tuck to help with the weight...maybe it will help me. I don't know how I'm going to help my daughter and seeing her cry every week because her belly aches is killing me. I wish we had more doctors paying attention to how much we suffer.I've spent many nights with a heating pad on my stomach curled up in a ball, not able to walk or sit up straight. My husband gets upset when I'm that way and hates that I have to be in so much pain...I wish all of you guys luck and hope we get relief soon.

365,"Hi, my name's Kate and I'm 20 years old. As I write this I'm currently in bed feeling terrible due to my IBS. I've only recently been medically 
diagnosed with having IBS, but my symptoms have been happening on and off for five years now.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));My first attack of excruciating stomach pains happened in secondary school. I had just finished my PE lesson on a particularly hot day and needed the toilet. After I had been to the toilet I sat down to have lunch with a group of friends and all of a sudden had the worst stomach pains imaginable. The school nurse thought that it was due to dehydration and made me drink plenty of water. I now believe that it was actually the start of IBS.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));Since being at college and university I've now lost count of the amount of times that a relative has had to be phoned in order to come and pick me up early from one of my placements that I've been on, due to me being bent double with spasms/gas due to my IBS. I haven't had regular bowel movements for as long as I can remember and would often go three or more days without doing anything, and then when suddenly I would feel the urge to go, I would be at least half an hour straining to do anything. Eventually when I did 
manage to go I'd feel that I hadn't quite finished.I constantly feel tired and that I have no energy. I often get unexplained aches or pains or am suffering from some kind of sore throat or 
fever. Several times I've woken up in the morning, gone to get out of bed and actually couldn't because I've had severe back pains, so I've had to 
just sit on the edge of the bed until they wore off.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Recently my IBS has got worse. In the last few months I've been admitted twice into hospital by ambulance due to severe abdominal pains. The most recent admission into hospital, I was actually at work when I began feeling unwell, so I took myself off to the toilet as I thought that I was going to be sick, due to severe stomach pains and nausea. That's the last thing I remember, until I found two paramedics leaning over me and giving me oxygen etc. I was told that I had passed out due to the intense pain that I was in.I've had so many different blood tests to rule out other illnesses/diseases over the past few months, that I'm getting sick and tired of it all. I often feel depressed, I've tried self-harming before, and I often get suicidal thoughts, though I do not believe I'd actually have the courage to carry out any of them.IBS seems to have taken over my life at the moment and myself and my family are constantly worrying about me. I get really concerned when I am driving anywhere late at night on my own, as I don't know when it will happen or what triggers it, and a few times I have developed excruciating stomach pains all of a sudden whilst driving. I'd hate to pass out at the wheel of my car or be to blame for causing a serious accident.I sympathize and empathize with anyone young or older who suffers from IBS, and if anyone would like to ask anything or just chat to someone who understands what they are going through, then don't hesitate to get in contact with me.

366,"I have suffered with IBS-C for about 10 years now. It started when I was around 20 and I went years with no diagnosis or medication. Finally a few years ago I was prescribed Zelnorm. It changed my life. Before Zelnorm I would miss days from work because of stomach issues. I would not go on an overnight trip with friends or boyfriends because of the fear.Last month I called to refill my Zelnorm and I was advised it had been pulled from the US market. I had two pills left and instantly felt depressed. I go two or three days with no bowel movement without Zelnorm. I get headaches and my back starts to hurt, and I am sure I am not pleasant to be around. Then when I finally do go on my own, it is so painful and urgent. I have hot flashes and chills and spend hours in the bathroom in severe pain.I called my doctor as soon as I learned of the Zelnorm recall. He gave me samples of Amitiza, I tried it for a week and the side effects are horrible. I have severe throat pains and feel like I can't take a deep breath. It gives me headaches and a weird flu-like feeling in my face and head. Not to mention it doesn't work for constipation. I have quit taking it and thrown out the samples.The last month or so of not having Zelnorm has been miserable. I missed my first day of work in years last week, and I canceled a family event today because my stomach felt so bloated I was scared to eat at anyone's house and have to run to the bathroom only to sit in there for hours with no relief. The Amitiza makes me even more bloated and gassy but gives no relief.I have an appointment next month (first available) with the GI doctor and am praying that I can continue to get Zelnorm. If anyone has had success in getting Zelnorm please let me know.

367,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));From reading over the sad and happy tales, I might have suffered longer than any other person who has submitted their story. When I was a child back in the 1950s I had a constipation problem off and on, so my mom would give me an enema, and to this day I hate enemas. By the time I was 12 and into my teens and early 20s, the constipation problems had subsided. In my mid-20s I started experiencing constipation off and on which would cause bouts of pain and numerous trips to the toilet to no avail. When I used laxatives they would finally work, but with great pain.By my late 20s I was not having much of a problem with constipation, until the fall of 1977 when I was 29 years old. My youngest son was 13 months old and my oldest son was 10. One weekday morning my stomach starting hurting, and I must have made at least 10 trips to the toilet, each time not accomplishing anything. By noon the pain was gone and so was my morning.A few days went by and I didn't have pain and my bowels moved daily, which once or twice a day was normal for me. Then one morning I had a repeat of the first morning, only the pain was worse and also I began to sweat, got clammy, started breathing heavily, almost hyperventilating, heart beating fast. I didn't understand what was going on.After numerous trips to the toilet my bowels painfully moved and I felt better. After that, about three to four mornings a week I would go through this painful process. I got to where I would pace around the house from room to room almost in a panic, and then running to the toilet. Sometimes my bowels would move and sometimes not. This all would last for one or two hours and afterwards I was be so exhausted.Over time it began to get worse, to the point that sometimes I would call my husband, who worked not too far from our house, and he would come home to spend a bit of time with me. The poor guy, he didn't know what to do other than to hug me and tell me to lie down, which would only make me feel worse. I didn't know what to call what I was experiencing so I started calling it 'my sick spell'.After a month or so, I mentioned my problem to my mom; she said I probably was having colon problems. Colon? I had to even ask her where my colon was. So I went to my doctor. He scheduled me for a barium test, which meant an enema. I was even more sick with the thought of having to undergo an enema (childhood fear) and the embarrassment of me baring my rear end to them.The diagnosis was spastic colon. I was told to be careful what I ate, though I was not really given much insight as to what not to eat other than if I ate something that bothered my stomach - don't eat it, gee thanks, and to drink more liquids and also take Metamucil. The first dosage of Metamucil felt like it just about tore my colon up! No more of that crap. I tried watching what I ate, but I loved to cook and eat.After a few more months I hadn't gotten better so I went to another doctor. He ran the same blasted test and diagnosed me with colitis. This 
doctor put me on Librax and also Gaviscon. He told me the Librax was a muscle relaxant and the Gaviscon was for acid problems. I had developed huge gas bubbles in my stomach which would cause me to belch hard and loud.My sick spells seemed to hit me in the mornings, but could happen anytime, especially when I was out shopping and such. I got to where every place I shopped I knew where the restrooms were and the fastest way to get there. More times than not I would rush out of the store and drive like a maniac to use my bathroom at home.I have to say it took probably three or four months before I noticed the Librax helping me. The Gaviscon seemed to help fairly quickly. As for food, I entered a paranoid world, worried about eating and analyzing everything I ate. After trial and error, my diet was made up of white bread, white rice, potatoes, scrambled eggs, bran flakes, basically anything white and plain. I ate nothing fried or deep fried, chocolate, ethnic foods, spicy foods, any tomato type sauces, whole wheat, nuts, popcorn, high fiber vegetables and fruits and no citrus foods.One year after the onset of my colon problems I had lost 30lbs, going from 128lbs to 92lbs. Family and friends that hadn't seen me for a while thought I had become anorexic. I monitored every thing I put in my mouth and fretted and worried the whole time. I know I drove my husband nuts about it all, but he was rather patient with me. The only comment he made that rather irritated me was that he said the reason I was having problems was because I was worrying so much about what I ate. Perhaps he was somewhat right, but it still irritated me.During all this the only people who knew about my problem were my husband, my mom and dad and of course my doctors. I never mentioned to my doctors about my sweating, clammy skin, rapid breathing or fast heart beat. I felt they would think I was crazy as I even thought I was perhaps going crazy.I went back to work as a legal secretary. Unfortunately I would miss work quite often or at least go in late. Finally after a year of being employed I was dismissed from my job due to so many absences. I felt like a failure, but was able to obtain another job, where I again missed work often and that job ended. At this point, we moved out of state and I tried staying home and I began to feel better, didn't have the sick spells as much. I continued taking my medications and watching what I ate. I did gain a few pounds back to where I didn't look anorexic.Eventually I was able to eat some of the former forbidden foods in very small amounts every so often. After that we moved back where we had lived previously and I did very well for about 10 years, though I did for a month in 1982 have a few sick spells, but otherwise things went well.In 1990 I was scheduled to start back to work at a childcare center I had been working at and had been off for the summer. I began to have painful cramps on the right side of my stomach. With my prior problems, the pain had always been on the left side of my stomach. These right side pains started being my sick spells again.I went to a doctor and was ran through various tests for gallbladder, etc. Finally, to my chagrin they ran a barium enema test. You would think the medical establishment could have found a less evasive way to run this embarrassing test. I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. I was mad because now I thought that I not only had a spastic colon but also had IBS! The doctor put me on Bentyl and said to perhaps stay away from carbonated drinks and ice cold drinks. The Bentyl seemed to help fine and I did start eating more, though carefully avoiding nuts and such. After that things went fine.Then in 1995 I started a new job with a law firm. My third month working, I went to work one morning feeling fine. I had a fat-free chocolate muffin for breakfast and coffee. At about 10am I started feeling panicky, sweating, etc along with stomach pain…basically my sick spell. I went to the restroom several times but did not have bowel movements.I paced the restroom, which had a window looking out at the tall buildings downtown (I was on the 26th floor). At one point I stood looking 
out the window and briefly it went through my mind what it would feel like to jump out the window. Of course, there is no way I would do that, I'm scared of heights, but I was so upset. I felt like just grabbing my purse and running away, but to where? You can't run from what I was feeling.I did finally leave work telling the office manager that I was feeling sick. I spent the next two days home, still not feeling well. I started back 
on Bentyl. Finally, for fear that I would lose this job, I went back to work and did OK for a few months.Later in 1995, I came across a book by Lucinda Bassett talking about something called panic attacks and anxiety attacks. I bought the book and read it. I began to think that part of my sick spells were maybe panic attacks.In the summer of 1996 my sick spells began to start again. They were offering panic and anxiety tests at the Women's Resonance Center where I live, and I took the test by filling out a long questionnaire. After the therapist went over my test she sat me down and began to explain what had maybe been going on with me. She referred to it as fright and flight. She used the example of a person being in the woods and coming across a bear. If that happened it would be natural to panic and run to get away. What I had been experiencing was the same thing - panic attacks.It was such a relief that I started crying, as it was a relief that my sick spells had a name for them. She then told me about a 12-week course 
they were going to be offering and asked if I was interested in signing up. At that time I was unemployed, so didn't sign up for it, but I did later, 
and it was the best $250 I have ever spent. I learned so much about panic attacks, we were taught some meditation and other relaxing techniques. After that I still had the IBS and panic attacks every so often but I got where I could control them.By 1997 I was doing better but was still depressed a lot. Over the next 10 years I really didn't have any of my sick spells, in other words panic attacks/IBS attacks, and if I happen to have one, I was able to relax, deep breath, visualize and get over it quickly.Now here it is spring 2008, and I hadn't really been having diarrhea problems for a couple of months. Recently though I went to work one morning, and at about 9am I started having mild stomach pains, went to the restroom, and had diarrhea off and on for an hour or so. I got to feeling worse and finally gave up and told them I had to go home as I was sick.I spent two days at home. I went back to work and felt fine for a few days and then started having problems again, I stayed at work grinning and bearing it. That evening I begin more in-depth research on IBS and came across Heather Van Vorous's website. I immediately reversed my eating going back to the soluble diet I had done 30 years ago. I bought some peppermint oil capsules, flaxseed oil, calcium/magnesium, etc.Last Thursday I was at work and mid-morning I started having diarrhea again, stomach pain and began to felt like I was going to start a panic attack. I was able to do some slow deep breathing and got myself calmed down. I made it to lunchtime and went home deciding to stay home. I called in sick…again. I had planned on going in on Friday, but I still felt sick and was so afraid that I would get to work and have diarrhea again, so I missed work on Friday.I did research on Librax and Bentyl and other medications plus reading IBS Tales. I called my doctor and told her what was going on and asked for Librax and surprisingly she didn't have me come into the office but prescribed Librax. I picked it up on Friday evening and immediately took one dose and then another at bedtime. I took one on Saturday morning I felt like I was in a daze. I was hoping to get as much Librax into my system as quickly as possible over the weekend so I would feel better by Monday for work. After that I decided to go with 2 a day so I wouldn't be so drowsy. When I took Librax in the 1970s and 1980s, I don't remember it making me drowsy.This morning I woke up, felt some nausea, and had some diarrhea, nothing too bad though. I got ready for work, all ready to go, sat on the edge of my bed and my thoughts went through my mind that I just can't face this. This fretting and worrying while at work about whether I'll have the pain, diarrhea and even panic attack. So I did the wimpy thing and called in to the employment agency to let them know that I wouldn't be in to work and that I couldn't complete the assignment due to my illness. I even told them that I have IBS. I think as one gets older, you have less pride.So now I have no job, no money and at this point no job prospects. I am separated from my husband, though he helps with my rent. I've been going through this 'my sick spell', spastic colon, colitis, IBS off and on for 30 years! The worries, wondering when my sick spells would hit me. Changing my life for the benefit of my sick spells. Planning my life where I could stay home in the mornings just in case due to having constipation problems and now diarrhea. I've lost numerous jobs and happiness due to this insidious disease!Looking back I can see where the doctors were as clueless as I was. From the medical establishment I got the message that my problems were more psychological than intestinal. Now I know that it was/is intestinal, which makes sense. I always wondered what came first the panic attacks or IBS for me. Now I know the IBS brought on my panic attacks. After years of suffering from constipation and then going for a number of years with normal bowel movements and now diarrhea, I can't figure out why this is happening to me again.Anyway, it has been a long 30 years, going from 29 years old to almost 60 years old with IBS. I read almost all the stories others have contributed to this website and I feel for every one of you. Especially for the people who were diagnosed with IBS as a child. As for me, I'm a persistent person and I no doubt will work hard at getting my diet and medication correct to get a handle on my IBS so I can live a happy life.

368,"A year and a half ago I was told that I had IBS after I had made several trips to the ER. I was spending most of my time on the couch eating very little, going nowhere, and becoming depressed. Constipation would last for almost a week, and even then I had lots of very painful cramping.My family doctor finally figured out that I had IBS. He said that I was the youngest person that he knows of to have IBS. I was 27. He put me on the medication Zelnorm. By the next day I felt like a brand new person. I was asking my mom to go shopping with me. My mom had not seen this person in almost a year. But as you know, six months after being put on the medication, I found out that it was being taken off the shelf.So after many trips to the doctor to find a new medication (many of which did not work or made me feel sick) now I'm taking the over-the-counter medicine Miralax. I'm still not the some person that I was when I was when I was on Zelnorm. Why is it that when a medication is helping so many people that someone has to find a reason to crush their dreams of having somewhat of a normal life? Constipation and abdominal cramping sucks.

371,"I have been suffering from constipation for my whole life, as long as I can remember. I remember the amount of times my mom would threaten to take me to the hospital to get an enema if I didn't go to the bathroom, particularly when she found out I hadn't been going for two or three days at a time. When I was a baby she used to have to give me Colace or a suppository in order for me to go properly.As I got older she had to give me laxatives like Agarol and even Exlax on top of an extremely healthy diet because my bowels were lazy. I wouldn't go for four or five days at a time and I would sit on the toilet for about 25 minutes straining and stomping my feet and willing the darn thing to come out. I didn't enjoy having to take laxatives either because of the accompanying stomach cramps and eventually the stubborn thing would slide out.Particularly the last couple of years, from my 11th grade year, I started getting sick a lot. My stomach always hurt, I always felt nauseous and I started missing a lot of school because of it. I almost got suspended because of it. My mom told the school it was a legitimate reason, that I honestly was sick.I didn't find out until about a year and a half ago, at age 20 (I'm turning 22 this month), that I am suffering from IBS-C and a gut motility 
disorder. It explained a lot. The gassy, bloated, sick horrible feelings I always had. Me getting sick more often than everyone else. Spending so much time on the toilet straining. Having to use laxatives and whatnot. It all made sense. The doctor started me on fiber therapy along with a stool 
softener and it was working for a while.Now the fiber is no longer working. I've tried changing my diet, cutting things out of it, I've tried eating Activia, I've tried drinking prune 
juice. It's becoming frustrating because it feels like I am running out of options. I feel fat, sick, bloated, gassy and horrible all the time. I'm five foot nine, 145lbs with a thin body...but a distended stomach that makes me look six months pregnant!My husband is being very supportive despite the fact that I have been sick and cranky a lot.

372,"I've had IBS constipation since my late teens and I'm in my mid-20s now. At first it started out mild for first two years and then by the third year it was severe and it's been like that ever since. When it was mild I had no idea why I was sick and went to doc after doc. Every doc didn't know what I had and they were very rude. Then by the the third year I was finally diagnosed by a doc after going through many, many tests. After I found it was IBS, I was floored that no doc I went to had any information for IBS. They would give me a horrible look and say 'just eat fiber' or 'I don't know how to help you' and walk out of the room.

I have tried many drugs but most of them made my symptoms worse and some only worked for a short period of time. I drink six to seven cups of herbal teas like mint, ginger, fennel, and chamomile. I also do many abdomen exercise involving pilates and follow the diet at Help for IBS, except I don't eat animals or animal by-products since they make my symptoms flare up. Also I'm a huge animal lover. I have found these things to be helpful to a certain degree.My symptoms interfere with my life a lot; I hardly go outside. It's extremely depressing. I have had to move back home since I can no longer work. I am struggling to get disability but sadly so far I have been denied which is not surprising. People really don't take IBS seriously.

373,"Several years back I was officially diagnosed with IBS. I asked my gastroenterologist what that actually meant. He said 'It means you have trouble with your intestines.' I asked him if he could be more specific, as in, what kind of symptoms do people usually get. He said 'You'll have gas, bloating, pain that is either minor or severe, diarrhea or constipation'. The list goes on... I then asked him what causes it. He said 'I don't know'. I then asked him if he ever speculated.

I told my gastro doc all about it. He said 'That's not normal. I've never heard of that medication doing that. You're weird'. I think that was an official diagnosis.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I have been going to a naturopathic doctor for the last few years as well. I like her much better, even though many of the things I've tried with her haven't worked either. Psyllium fiber, some awful prune, cornmeal and date breakfast, halibut oil, flaxseed, probiotics, digestive enzymes...I'm sure if I go through my pill baskets I'd find 30 or more bottle of things tried and failed. Some seem to work for a week or two, but nothing has lasted any longer. In the end (pardon the pun) I have no choice but to resort to enemas and sodium phosphates, my explosives, or anything that my intestines aren't supposed to become addicted to.My gastro doc once put me on sodium phosphates for three months. He said 'Your bowels need a little vacation. They'll start working on their own after this'. Anyone who has ever had a colonoscopy knows what this stuff is. It turns everything in your belly to liquid. First, you swell up like a balloon and then the faucet goes on. My husband gave me a new nickname during this period: Squirt!My belly didn't start to work after that. Apparently they either didn't receive a long enough vacation or simply never had any intention of doing their job. It's kind of like having a difficult employee. You know you can't fire them and you can't replace them either.I've begun to believe that my stomach has a mind of its own. It's on its own schedule. It's incredibly lazy and it's a pack rat. It wants to keep everything it comes into contact with. It's grumpy and it's ornery. It has some serious issues. It not only has a mind of its own, it's neurotic!That's why I was so amazed to hear on the news one evening that scientists had discovered that our stomachs have grey matter - the same kind of tissue we have in our heads. I looked it up. It's true. In fact, 95% of the serotonin in our bodies is in our intestines. Nerve cells in our tummies use serotonin to signal information to the brain about digestion, like pain, gas, comfort and terrible 'gut' feelings from anxiety. Our bellies work in tandem with our brains, but they also work in isolation.My mother attributed my IBS complaints to stress. I think she also thought I was a hypochondriac, just like some of the old medical texts would have me diagnosed. Well, for once, I can say to my Mom 'You were right, sort of'. Apparently we all have two 'brains'.Before I came to the conclusion that my bowels had a mind of their own, I thought I had alien DNA (it's possible!). I looked up foods and herbs that increased serotonin levels in the body. Bananas, cheese, beer (alcohol), and sugar and carbs have been known to make me 'go'. No - prunes, coffee and all the rest of the normal stuff never worked. This has led me to self-diagnose myself as having NBS - Neurotic Bowel Syndrome.I'm going to my doctor to ask him if he'll send me for a blood test to measure my serotonin levels. I may have too little or too much of the stuff. I may have to go on some happy pills! I should ask my gastro doc what he thinks. I wonder what he'll say?E-mail Linda:[email protected]",,pain,stomach,.doc,serotonin,kind,brain,kind,body,mother,neurotic
374,"I have had IBS forever it seems. I have had it since I was a child but no-one knew what was wrong with me. When I was 20 I learned I had IBS, even though they had thought I had colitis and I went through many meds for this. I suffer from both constipation and diarrhea. I have been to so many doctors I have lost count over the years. I sometimes feel so alone in my IBS prison.My latest torture was being put on a drug called Effexor XR. It was awful for me, I only took half a capsule and I had awful side effects for three days. I would rather have IBS then ever feel that way again. I have no faith in doctors anymore and I can't even get relief from the anxiety I feel. I am scared to leave my house at times - what will happen to me again, 100th time in the toilet again. I feel like I should have a toilet tied to my butt wherever I go. As I get older it gets worse. All doctors want to do is throw pills at me and put hoses in my butt! I'm so tired of this.

375,"I'm a 37 year-old mother of two teenagers. In September of 2007 I was at the hospital for an upper respiratory infection. The doctors called my PCP and he ordered something called z-pack. I went home, took it and about an hour later I started feeling weird so I went back to the hospital and they told me I was allergic to it. They also took a urine sample which came back saying that I had E. coli. They gave me meds to cure that.My PCP at the time was a quack so my father suggested I go to his doctor which was a real relief. He ordered a colonoscopy and another test to see down my throat. Everything came back normal but the gastroenterologist said that I had IBS. He said it was due to either the E. coli or the nine years of meth I went through. My PCP put me on Klonopin and Vicodin, and Pristiq for pain. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depression because of this. It's hard to deal with this, it's all I think about. I go to therapy, and this helps me get a lot off my chest, but still it's a constant thought.Right now I'm going through constipation and don't know what to do about it. I just thought you might want to know that I have been drug-free for two years and maybe my body is still healing. All I know is I wish someone would tell me I'm not crazy.

376,"I have read and related to so many of these stories that now I am crying knowing I really don't have to suffer alone! I have suffered with stomach problems since I was 16 (I am 42 now!) only then it was labeled spastic colon, quite daunting for a young girl! Over the years my symptoms have worsened and periods of stress and anxiety make the condition that much more intolerable.When I have a bout I feel a sickness that I cannot describe and family and friends cannot believe and I spend hours traveling between my bed and the bathroom (I lost three pounds in weight during my last bout two days ago!). When I finally finish 'going' the sickness subsides but the weakness takes over and a raging headache and then hunger! I am then terrified to eat because I know that I will not go to the toilet for a week and things will start all over again, so the weakness stays for days.I have recently been referred for cognitive behavioral therapy and will also be starting a yoga course in an attempt to beat my stress and anxiety issues, but I still need help with the physical symptoms which I know will not subside immediately. Therefore I visited the doctor. I broke down in the doctor's surgery yesterday when she told me there really was very little she could do to help. I pleaded with her that I needed it to stop so she read her little book of medicines and finally decided that I should try mebeverine, anyone heard of it?

After a few years of that I became constipated almost all the time. I could go to the bathroom, but only in small amounts, my stomach always hurt, and I always had gas. If I ate anything my stomach instantly bloated.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));I feel like I wake up in the morning with a flat stomach and go to bed at night with a huge belly. I had diarrhea and constipation until I was about 18, which was when I had my first child. Then it just became constipation all the time. I am 22 now and it is still the same. I hate to eat because putting anything in me besides water upsets my stomach and makes it fill with gas.

Sometimes I just cry because I am so sick of living like this, and there seems to be no end to it. I envy those who have normal bowel habits, who don't have to take laxatives every couple of days to go. I would almost rather have diarrhea than the constipation because the pain with my constipation is way worse than it ever was with diarrhea. And because I just want my body to be able to have a bowel movement without needing something to force it to.Sometimes it gets so bad the pain makes me vomit. If I don't take laxatives to make myself have a bowel movement I will end up in the bathroom for hours one day in pain because my body will finally get rid of it all. But it is so extremely painful, I would rather deal with a little cramping from the laxatives every couple of days. I am so sick of living like this.

378,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Where do I start my tale? I think I'll begin with describing my medical history (yes, at 23 I have a considerably long history with doctors, clinics, hospitals, specialists and medication). I've always had digestive problems ever since I was 14, but what I was suffering from was chronic pain, and then finally last year the doctors discovered I had gallbladder stones and opted to remove them surgically which I agreed to happily. I thought that would be the end of my problems, and so it was for a whole year. I ate whatever I wanted and was happy, except for certain times when I had diarrhea but I didn't mind so much.And then about two months ago my car died on me. You'll be wondering how this is relevant, please wait and read. I live away from my family and drive to work every day, and taxis and public transportation are not common where I live (more of that later). And when my car died I had to rely on my friends to come and pick me up, which put me at the mercy of their whims. I am grateful to them, don't get me wrong, but my whole life depended on who would come pick me up or drop me off, which is even worse because some of them like to stay till 7 or 8pm!My car took forever to get fixed and that caused me to get stressed and angry. I have a horrible temper, but since it was no-one's fault (except my idiotic car) I kept it inside. Until, funnily enough, I got my car back. The next day I suffered from nausea attacks. I went to the ER and was prescribed some medication. Two days after that I got the worst gut-wrenching pain in my lower abdomen which was complemented with a fever. The ER doctor who saw me told me it was an inflammation in the Pouch of Douglas. If you're curious about what that is then please google it and marvel at the doctor's stupidity.My drugs were changed and replaced with antibiotics and I had to beg the doctor to give me a sick leave sheet for the office (I went into the ER at 1am and left at 5:30am, lucky for me I wasn't dying or I'd already be dead!). The drugs weren't helpful, the pain was too bad to allow me to sleep and a friend took me to a doctor who performed a number of tests on me but couldn't find anything wrong and told me it could be that my colon (I hate this word now) was agitated. He told me to cut back on certain foods (fried and spicy and fatty food mainly) but he was more sympathetic than the ER doctor and gave me three days off.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));The next three weeks were hell for me. I would get bloated for no apparent reason, I ate all the healthy food I could think of but that still didn't help. It would get so bad that I would want to pass gas but couldn't even do that and I wouldn't go to the bathroom for five days. The funny thing was when I did my stool was normal! I was perplexed and finally went to a specialist where an argument ensued.I had read a bit about IBS (a close friend of mine has been suffering for almost a year now, and I wanted to know how I could help), so I knew it was a lifelong condition. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I would get the condition too. So when the doctor told me I was suffering from IBS-C I refused to accept the diagnosis. I wanted something curable! You can't say that my whole life will have to be controlled by my intestines, and expect me to sit down and nod my head wisely.Here comes the part about where I live: I'm an Arab, a Jordanian precisely, and I live in Dubai. IBS I think is quite common here but no-one likes to talk about it. And the way doctors treat it here is abominable. My doctor told me that my temper was the cause of my IBS, all that anger and stress had to go somewhere she said, and this is the result. Do you know how it feels to be told that your IBS was caused by you? That you have done this to yourself? It was a terrible couple of days after that, I just wanted to stay home and do nothing, but even that was not easy.My family was not sympathetic, my grandmother made fun of me, saying that she'd never heard of constipation causing a person to visit a doctor and that I just wanted attention. And my parents were always mad at me for refusing to eat certain foods (such as bananas and fried food for example), and kept telling me to try and eat and forget that I was sick. Right, I'm supposed to ignore the fact that I only go to the bathroom once or twice a week, and look like I'm six months pregnant, and my IBS will just fly out the window!What also added to my misery was that I'd been going to the gym regularly after my gallbladder was removed, and that I had finally almost gotten the flat stomach with a four-pack that I always wanted. Now it just takes the wrong kind of food or a stressful situation and the gym goes out the window in three seconds.I am now in Japan on vacation. The first two weeks were fantastic! I had somewhat regular bowel movements, can't say they were normal but nothing to complain about (damn I miss those days when I didn't have to think about how long I hadn't gone to the bathroom, or how much gas there is in my bowels!). I ate everything, fried food, coffee, cakes and sweets. I thought that maybe my doctor was wrong, maybe I didn't have IBS!And today, just so my bowels can tell me not to forget about them, I got a lovely case of bloating and gas. I had to sit for one hour in the bus trying not to pass the noxious gas that I know would kill half the passengers and cause the other half to faint. And when I reached my hotel room, all I could do was wallow in my misery and google IBS again...Thank God I found this site, I know I'm not alone.But still...I wonder, why did this have to happen? What on earth did we do to deserve this? And why don't people try and understand that I'm not playing around, I don't want attention, I'm even fine living all on my own without any human contact for the next year if that meant my IBS would disappear! I'm just hoping my remaining week here passes in peace, I don't want a perfect bowel, just one that can handle the rest of the vacation, and the 19-hour flight back to Dubai.

379,"On April 16 2009 I made an executive decision to start playing tennis again. Everything was smooth sailing until I felt a sharp pain on the lower right side of my abdomen. I thought it was my ovary since I had surgery in July of 2008 to have a huge dermoid cyst removed.I panicked after my game of tennis. I thought that I may have ruptured my ovary. I immediately left a message for my surgeon explaining the horrible pain. My surgeon scheduled a sonogram for me the following week. Needless to say, on Monday, April 17 I felt horrible.  On April 18 I was immobilized by the pain. I thought I was going to die. The pain was nothing like when I had ovarian surgery, so I went to the emergency room that night and was diagnosed with multiple fibroids. I was released with 800 mg of ibuprofen.I felt bloated, irritated, and lethargic. I had a follow-up appointment with my gynecologist and she explained that my fibroids were too small to cause the amount of pain that I was experiencing. I explained my symptoms like the pressure in my lower abdomen and not being able to sit for a long period of time, frequently having to urinate, but having trouble removing the urine, a weird fluttering feeling moving through that area, nausea, and heartburn at times. My gynecologist thought it was a urinary tract infection and gave me medication that caused a world of problems.I waited five days to see if the medication would work. The medication did not work of course. I had a horrible reaction to the meds and had to miss three days of work. I was miserable and worried about my problems...and to top it all off, I had a case of the sniffles with a whole lot of sneezing. It was one of the worst colds that I had for the season.I was under an extreme amount of stress at home and work. I was using up my accrued sick/annual leave time from work. While I was at home suffering I did a ton of research. I thought I had an obstructed bowel and began to take suppositories, but they did not work. I went back to the doctors again, but my physician was busy working rounds at the hospital and as usual I had to see the nurse practitioner. She told me that it could very well be an obstructed bowel and scheduled a catscan for the following week. I never made it to the catscan because I went back to the emergency room.While at the ER I was given morphine for my sharp spasms and a pill for the nausea. I was given a catscan, internal vaginal check, and a belly x-ray. I spent a total of 7.5 hours for them to tell me that I was constipated. The nurse gave me magnesium citrate and told me I should/would move with-in 45 minutes. Well...I didn't! I was still constipated!I took off that following day to take a series of laxatives. They did not work. I went to the store to buy some more magnesium citrate. I did move my bowels that weekend, but I still felt horrible after I ate and drank. I would also still have issues of not being able to move without that horrible tasting laxative.I went back to the doctors for a follow-up and I was told that I may have IBS. I didn't get a diagnosis because I saw a nurse practitioner again. She advised me to buy some Miralax and take a capful daily. Miralax is $12 a small bottle. I questioned the nurse and asked if I should get a referral to see my gastrointestinal specialist. She advised that it would not be necessary because the specialist would perform a colonoscopy and they too would come up with the same conclusion.So it's now week four and I have IBS. I am struggling and trying to figure out my food triggers. All I can say is that I am truly going through a lot of pain. I am literally finding out on a daily basis what causes my bloating and pains. I am still taking magnesium citrate because I am not going to spend $10 to $20 on Miralax. I am going to schedule an appointment with my specialist for a prescription for Glycolax. I am wondering why the doctors that I saw never thought IBS was the issue.

380,"I've had IBS for five years. When I started with the diarrhea I thought I had food poisoning. I even called the restaurant I'd had lunch at the day before to complain about their 'under-cooked chicken'. After two weeks I realized there was something...just not right.I was on a pattern of constipation for four or five days, and then random, 'all hell is breaking loose' diarrhea. I would get little to no warning before I had to go. The cramp pain was so bad that I began to get panic attacks while I was sitting on the toilet. All I could do was sit and go, then curl in the fetal position on the bathroom floor. Repeat. I would push and strain even after I knew there was nothing left inside me. Not that I wanted to, but I had to. The day after an episode I would have tremendous gas pain up under my ribs.After several months I developed this feeling that I had to be completely naked when I had an attack. Jewelry, glasses, everything had to come off. Sometimes this happened at work! It was very time-consuming and embarrassing, because when I had to go, I had to go. And I moaned because of the pain, which was also mortifying in a public restroom.After two years I decided to go to the doctor. He diagnosed me with IBS with constipation and gave me Bentyl. Ah, sweet Bentyl! It was a true lifesaver. The doctor explained that my constipation was holding all the new poo behind it. He said that after the pressure gets too much it blows open and that's where the diarrhea comes from.After another year my IBS swung to the other extreme, and it's been there ever since - constipation. I only go every five to 10 days, and it isn't much. I have tried most everything I can think of, even Amitiza, a prescription from my doc. I've tried enemas, teas and herbal remedies. I've tried bulk, fiber, fiber capsules, fiber chewables, fiber drinks, fiber, fiber fiber! Right now I have three different bottles of colon cleanser on my desk at work and not one of them works for me. Water - I drink two bottles every day at work, and all evening long. I drink coffee and tea. I pee like a fiend but have a bloated, uncomfortable feeling all the time.When I do go it is so condensed and hard (fiber, anyone?) and literally feels like I'm giving birth through my rectum. I tear and bleed but thankfully, I am able to remain fully dressed, don't have panic attacks and don't need to lay on the floor. No gas pain afterwards, either. I will say that honestly, it isn't any better for me to be constipated or loose.The only time I really feel good is when I take a laxative, which I only do if I haven't gone for that magical number of 10 days. I figure after 10 days it's time to shake things up down there. I had to laugh when I read the product info in the Amitiza package, 'Most people have a bowel movement within 24 hours'.

381,"I am only 23, but I have been dealing with IBS my entire life. It used to be just bloating and constipation. After many talks with my pediatrician when I was young they put me on Glycolax (Miralax). It helped a bit but they would not refer me to a specialist because they said I was too young. I lived with the IBS for years after that. During my third year in college I was rushed to the hospital for what was thought to be a bursting appendix. It turned out to be a severe intestinal blockage in my large intestine that almost ruptured.That summer I was finally referred to a specialist. I had a colonoscopy and an exam. The results of the exam (at age 20) showed fissures and internal hemorrhoids. The colonoscopy only found that I have a tortuous colon. At that point I was officially diagnosed with severe IBS. I tried a medication called Amitiza. The doctor told me that this was the only FDA-approved medication at the time. Forty-five minutes after taking my first pill I had a severe allergic reaction to it (shortness of breath, heart palpatations, loss of all bodily functions in front of my boyfriend in my car).

I feel like I have been tortured for a full year and I am still suffering.When I was pregnant there was nothing that my GI specialist could do for me until I had the baby. I finally saw my GI about six weeks ago where he wanted to do a sigmoidoscopy to see how bad the hemorrhoids were and to see if banding was an option. At that time it was not and the surgeon who saw me afterwards recommended that I take milk of magnesia (one medication I had not tried).  He told me that I have to have a bowel movement at least once a day and that this should help make the hemorrhoids smaller and my bowels work more regularly. Thanks to this wonderful product I have been going every morning and my hemorrhoids are getting smaller but they are still really painful.I did have banding done about four weeks but it was so painful that I will never have it done again unless I am put under or at least given a sedative.

I have got to the point when I don't even want to make love to my wonderful husband as I feel so damn unattractive - belching and farting are not really turn-ons are they?

I also started taking probiotics, ground flax and soy protein in a smoothie daily. This helped somewhat but the constant bouts of bloating and constipation were so distressing and painful.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));I became so frustrated at the impact my increasing symptoms had on my overall life and wellbeing...but I pressed on choosing not to give up! I got a referral to a throat specialist because of very unusual symptoms of spasm type pains in my throat plus a sensation of food being stuck in my throat. He did an uncomfortable throat scope in the office and sent me for a barium swallow which confirmed acid reflux with no known cause.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I was then referred to a GI specialist and sent for a colonoscopy and endoscopy (this doctor's bedside manner was horrific and I felt almost traumatized!). After a very teary experience I learned that the only result was that my bowels had many twists. Surprisingly, I had about seven or eight months symptom-free after the colonoscopy! I thought that after my c-section (vertical) there has been scar tissue forming over the years combined with the possibility that my bowels were not put back in place - hence the twists. I also feel that stress and PTSD have irritated the IBS.During my symptom-free phase I began to eat whatever I wanted again and my lifestyle change through diet went right out the window. About two months ago I flared up again. I was so frustrated with myself because I didn't watch what I ate nor did I take care of myself through stress management, exercise etc.Like many of the sufferers here I have tried a multitude of remedies, diets, supplements, laxatives, herbs etc. I now resolve to 'listen to my body' and I have gotten back to my daily food log (everything in and out) and writing my symptoms down. I have gone back to my GP for a referral to Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Ontario (I have heard great things about it) so I can get a second opinion.Last night I spent 10 hours in the ER waiting to see a doctor because I flared up so severely with bloating, constipation and pain. The doctor had a rude bedside manner and I left in tears feeling worse than when I went in. Blood work and urine screens came back normal.I can so identify with the emotional roller coaster that goes with this journey. I am so grateful to have found this website - I no longer feel alone! Thank you all so much...I feel hope again and I have already jotted down a bunch of new tips that I am excited to try.My biggest frustration is that I have turned my life around in the past 10 years and today have years of sobriety from alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and even coffee and sugars (especially chocolate!). I am remarried to a wonderful, supportive man, I have great teenagers (most times ha ha) and a fantastic career. I am frustrated because this is the time in my life where I want to live feeling fully alive and I feel so physically ill, fatigued and emotionally fearful and stressed!  Deep sigh.I am facing these feelings and choosing to do something different. I am going for reflexology and deep tissue massage plus prayer and meditation for the stress. I am taking a weekend vacation with my family to relax this weekend and I am standing firm with the doctors and getting the second opinion that I deserve. I will not let this 'minor inconvenience' take over my life and I will continue to press forward.I would really love to hear from others who have shared their stories and I look forward to experiencing the mutual support that I am finding on this website. If there is anyone here from the Toronto, Ontario area and knows of a support group for IBS I would love to hear from you.E-mail Wendy:[email protected]",,doctor,doctor,stress,throat,tissue,email,mutual support,website,opinion,acid

388,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I've had IBS for a long time. It runs in my mother's side of the family. Many times as a child I would spend nights in the bathroom, doubled over in pain so bad that I thought I was going to die. It was the first time in my life I ever thought about suicide. I didn't even know what that meant at the time, I just remember thinking about putting a gun to my head because I couldn't bear the pain. It's scary to think about now. I was in middle school. The pain was that bad. I slept in the bathroom floor more than a few times, covered in a blanket. I never had a normal schedule. I was afraid of school trips and vacations. I hated that my parents had to wait for me every time I had a bad flare-up.My doctor when I was younger took stool samples and listened to my stomach and intestines with a stethoscope. He said my guts were contracting at a much faster rate than is normal, and that it caused my pain to be worse than is usual. I took Zantac for quite a while. It sometimes helped me from getting violently sick after certain foods, but it was in no way a cure.Fast forward. Same problems throughout high school. I often had to go to the office and ask to go home because the pain was too much. I couldn't even sit in class without doubling over and shifting around in abdominal pain. Needless to say, I wasn't learning anything when I had flare-ups in class. The drive home was hell. Our roads are very bumpy, and every one of them jarred my guts and sent a wave of pain through me.I also had a lot of trouble with anxiety causing immediate flare-ups. I've always been a nervous person, and at any big function like a dance I would almost always get sick and have to spend a lot of time in the bathroom. Zantac helped a little, but it didn't stop it. My doctor said I had peptic acid disease. (No idea if he was really right.)I finally stopped taking Zantac later in high school. I would just eat and do my normal activities, and handle the flare-ups. I tried stool softeners. They were very little help. If I didn't use the restroom in a week I would take two extra-strength laxative pills before bed. The next morning I was guaranteed a very painful BM and relief for the day. After this, my stomach (or intestines?) would ache badly after I ate for the first time after the painful BM that cleared me out. It was like it was stretching back out after being squished empty.I was slapped in the face right after I started college with my first panic attack. I say first because I had chronic panic attacks for a long time after that. It was the beginning of a miserable life. I've been on a plethora of different medications now. Anti-depressants, Xanax (always on Xanax, the doses just go up and down, which makes my digestion even slower) etc. I'm now on Xanax, Cymbalta and Miralax.My new doctor said I do have IBS. He told me to take Miralax once a day, and that I could take it every day to help regulate my BMs. I am happy to say that it has helped me very much! It is no miracle cure, I won't lie. It just keeps me from backing up and experiencing the excruciating pain that I once had to fear so often. It does a good job of making all my BMs soft and easy to pass.The effects vary. My IBS is a lot better than it was. I go fairly regularly now, and I still have the occasional flare-up, but never do I go anywhere near a whole week without a movement anymore. I have to be careful to skip a dose after diarrhea, since I don't want to overdo things. I can't say that it doesn't work perfectly. I have to place a lot of the blame on Cymbalta and Xanax for slowing my system down so much that the constipation is much harder to resolve.I forgot to mention that I had an upper GI and a colonoscopy. They found nothing, but the doctors took a biopsy from my intestinal wall and it came back clean. My gallbladder was only 18% functional, and the hospital surgeon wanted me to have it removed, but my primary care doctor said that if it was him, he wouldn't, and that that wasn't too abnormal.I know I've left a lot out, but I hate to ramble. Reading this site has made me feel a lot better about myself, knowing that I'm not the only one. (I knew I wasn't, but reading the stories on here makes it a lot more real.) I should also mention that my IBS also triggers panic attacks because I get backed up and it actually pressures my lungs and my heart seems to skip beats a lot when I am really bloated.I need to dissolve my Miralax in coffee. I always dissolve it in a water bottle, but it doesn't seem to want to dissolve completely.

I pass gas and it's very embarrassing, but the worst part is the pain. When I am constipated I have severe abdominal pain that drives me crazy. I'm only 40 and I have a good job. Fortunately I can work, so far.Four years ago I went back to school, and I'm thinking about a career change to make more money.

I make sacrifices, such as avoiding many foods I like, but nothing helps. I take fiber and medications but it still gets worse.

392,"I have been suffering with IBS-constipation and a slow digestive system for many years. I first noticed that I had a digestive problem in the early 90s but continued living life like it didn't exist. Later, I started experiencing heartburn and just took over-the-counter remedies. But the biggest hit on my system was when I had three consecutive operations in three years: a hysterectomy, gallbladder removal and a stomach wrap. A few weeks after I had the hysterectomy, I would throw up half an hour after eating, sometimes to the point where my stomach was raw. My bowels were also not working properly.I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with H. pylori bacteria which they treated with a strong antibiotic. This only added to the distress in my body.  A few months went by without the heaving but then it started up again with much bloating and constipation. I went to a surgeon who ran tests on my gallbladder and suggested that I have it removed, so I did. The heaving started up again after several months and I went to another stomach doctor, who informed me that I had classic GERD. He suggested that I have a stomach wrap, which I did. The downside of the wrap is if you get nauseated you can't heave. The brain has to tell the stomach to go the other way, which really doesn't work for me.The last two years have not been good. I suffer now with bloating, constipation, sensitive joints, rashes that appear and disappear, weight gain and extreme fatigue. Last year I did find some things that I know aggravate my system, eg: sugar, caffeine, spicy foods and milk. Sugary things build up more gas in my digestive system and also add to my fatigue. Sometimes the gas is so bad because of my stomach not emptying that I feel as though I am having a heart attack.I'm very discouraged at this point with my doctors. I've paid out so much in co-pays with no definitive results. I'm not sure of what I can or cannot eat. Sometimes my stomach will turn sour and burn which gives me (or adds to) my hot flashes. My ears will turn beet red and my body feels like it is on fire. I'm thankful for this website. Maybe there is someone out there who has the same symptoms that I have.

393,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I have been wanting to talk about my experience as a child with IBS for a long time, but I have never been able to. So I have written my story here. It is sad, but I really wanted to put it out there just in case anyone is in a similar situation.Nearly all of my earliest memories have to do with my bowel. They are invariably embarrassing and still fill me with shame and discomfort, so much so that I have never talked to anyone about them and cannot imagine doing so. When I tell people that I was bullied in school, they ask why, and I cannot give them an honest answer.I remember locking myself in the toilet for entire lessons in Year One (age six). I remember a teacher having to wipe me in a bathroom after I soiled myself. I remember learning the term 'soiled myself' after a teacher spoke to me through a cubicle door during the before-school activities time I had to go to because my mom was also a teacher and so needed to drop me off early. I remember soiling myself with diarrhea time and time again at school and not knowing how to tell anyone, thinking that no-one would notice and I could just go home and sort myself out at the end of the day.I remember children smelling the floor where I'd sat and thinking I'd farted. I don't know if they ever realized what had actually happened. I remember teachers taking me out of class to try to talk to me about it, but I don't remember ever telling them. I remember sitting on the toilet with severe diarrhea just before school started and my favorite teacher coming in and complaining about the smell. I called out to her, but I don't remember what happened next.I would also get constipated, but then when I had a movement it would be so painful that I would try to hold it in instead, and I remember my mother telling me off because I would often try to hide the cramps by standing behind a chair or sofa and holding on. I remember my parents cleaning me up for years longer than they should have done because I would get so distraught and be in so much pain after a bout that I couldn't clean myself.I remember the trauma of swimming, something which I loved doing, but the water would make me want to go to the bathroom. The same happened with baths, and I would often have accidents in the bath that I would try to hide. I remember having diarrhea at school earlier in the day and walking home later.I didn't know anyone else who had ever had this sort of problem. I felt alone, a freak, almost to the point of feeling suicidal. It made me an easy target for bullying, because even though they didn't know the problem, they knew that I was vulnerable and unhappy.My parents took me to doctors galore. They tried to make it into a game, with rewards if I could have a bowel movement. It might seem that my main problem was that I had diarrhea, but really I was always constipated. My parents would give me liquid Senokot, which tasted foul and upset my stomach enough to induce a movement. I didn't know that that was what they were doing, and so my life was full of uncertainty and horrible experiences that I didn't understand.I remember sobbing to my dad not to give it to me when I was having a good time, since all it ever did was ruin everything, why couldn't he only give it to me when I was already miserable? I remember stomach cramps, straining so hard that I was sick, having movements so large that I tore and thought I had piles from the pain and itching as it healed.I remember doctors wanting to do a rectal exam but not being able to because I was so constipated. I remember referring to 'the feeling' for the urgent need to go. My father told me that he had had similar problems as a child, which made me feel more embarrassed, and also angry that he was continuing to put me through this pain even though he must know what it was like!Then I started manipulating people. I had permission in primary school to go and sit in the sick room toilet if I was having problems. I used to go and sit there to get out of whole lessons I didn't like, but it was incredibly boring. I became really introverted because I couldn't talk to anyone about it. It felt shameful, embarrassing and stupid. I remember my mother finding that I'd soiled myself at home and hadn't told her, and she was so angry that all I did was deny I knew. Then she got even angrier that I couldn't tell I'd done it. I always knew, but I didn't want to have to face the horrible thing I'd done.My parents never explained what was wrong with me. They never explained what they were doing in giving me Senokot. They never realized the pain, confusion, shame, embarrassment and horror of what they put me through for all those years. My childhood was made a misery from badly-managed IBS.My parents stopped giving me Senokot when I went to secondary school, and I lied to them whenever I could, saying that I was better and had no problems anymore. I think they were ashamed of what they'd done. It wasn't until I was 17 that I finally realized that having a movement once or twice a week was not normal and saw a doctor. He prescribed soluble fiber, which brought my regularity up to three or four times a week.Now I manage the problem myself, to the extent that I can function practically normally. To anyone whose child might be showing signs of IBS, I urge you not to put them through what my parents put me through. It is a horrifying enough illness without that. Don't make them feel ashamed of what they have to deal with. Don't medicate them without telling them what will happen. Don't make them as miserable as I was.E-mail Katherine:[email protected]",,parent,toilet,teacher,teacher,child,school,pain,doctor,doctor,home
394,"When I was three days old I had to go back to the hospital because I was constipated. I also had an upper and lower GI done. It turns out that since I was my mom's 'miracle baby' it came at a price. I have a plethora of digestive issues, including but not limited to: a spastic colon, spasmatic poloric stenosis, spastic illiocecal valve, severe food allergies and an extra 10-15ft of large intestine. Woo hoo!Having had constipation my entire life I'd gotten used to it; for years nothing I took got me normal. I'd take a dump around once a week and that was normal for me. Once I started surfing seven days a week, several hours a day, I started going daily, which was nice. After an auto accident that left me with a broken back, my body went back to its old ways since I couldn't surf anymore, and being on some hardcore pain meds just made matters worse.Now I'll evacuate my big old bowels once every 10 days. My dumps are big enough to name; it's like delivering a baby via my arse. Miralax, magnesium citrate, Ex-lax, stool softeners...none of them worked. My bowels are so impacted I was going to hit the ER a few days ago. Amazingly, I passed a softball the other day, just as I was ready to hit the clinic to get something done about the rest of the impaction.I decided for to try some MOM. I bought a 26oz bottle today and drank a third of it. So far, nothing. Because of my birth defect, if I take a laxative or anything else that is instant or works in a few hours for normal people, it'll take a few days to work for me. I weighed myself just before I downed almost half of the bottle and I am actually surprised to feel a little gurgle going on.

395,"It all started when I was 18. I am now 23. I suffered from severe stomach problems and constipation and I was diagnosed with IBS. I was given omeprazole for the stomach pain, Movicol and Lactulose for the constipation, domperidone for the nausea and vomiting and Buscopan and mebeverine for the pain.It gradually got worse. Bowel movements were not happening at all and I ended up being admitted to hospital on several occasions after the laxatives, enemas and suppositories had no effect. The first time I was admitted to a medical department I was discharged with senna, Lactulose and Movicol and an outpatient colonoscopy. The colonoscopy results were not good as the Movi prep did not clear my bowel. The second time I was admitted to general surgery I was kept in and given Klean Prep (medicine given prior to a colonoscopy) to take to make my bowels move. I was then discharged with Klean Prep to take once or twice weekly, along with glycerol suppositories.After a time I was admitted again with the same problem and they had to enhance the amount of Klean Prep. I was admitted on several more occasions with the same complaint. In October 2012 I was admitted to hospital with severe right-sided abdominal pain which they thought was appendicitis. I was taken into theater which revealed a small bowel obstruction and adhesions.Three months later I ended up back in hospital with the same type of pain, along with bleeding. I had an MRI scan of the small bowel which was clear. I was admitted several times over the next few months with severe bleeding. I was then refered to a bowel specialist. I had the balloon test and a short course of biofeedback. I was prescribed Movicol liquid, methycellulose, glycerol suppositories, Buscopan, a higher level of domperidone and a higher dose of bisacodyl.I was seen again by general surgery due to rectal bleeding. I had an examination under anaesthetic and the surgeon thought I had an intusseception. I had an MRI, a pelvic floor scan which did not show an intussuception but did show pelvic floor weakness and this has to be discussed at a meeting. During this time I was working as a student and was off sick a lot. They did not understand. It's a lot for a youngster or in fact anyone to deal with. It brings great strain on my family.I've had various types of anti-spasmodics that do not help with pain. I have severe pain every day. I don't see the possibility of returning to part-time work as I am so ill. I had a discussion with my GP last week and talked about 'quantity' and 'quality' of life and I emphasized that I have no quality of life.

My doctor always called it IBS and said there was no treatment. I was led to believe, until I found a GI, that there was nothing to do but suffer. Sophie said that when she has an attack, she is on the toilet for like an hour or two. I have poopdays. I can literally endureweeks, two or three weeks with no poop at all...and then I have an attack and I am on the toiletallday writhing in pain, crying and sweating, shaking and sick.I am unable to poop without help. Since finding my GI and getting tested for everything under the sun and ruling out all else, I officially got diagnosed with IBS-C and I have found some relief with Miralax every day. If I don't take it, I don't poop. Sophie also didn't think that anxiety was a big part of your triggers but it is for me. I can't poop for anything but if I get anxious about something, especially going on a trip or even if I'm worried about a problem, I have instant and explosive attacks of severe diarrhea, horrible cramping and unbearable pain. I still can't help those, but if I have been pooping with the Miralax, the attack might be a bit better.I don't have a phobia of pooping in a public place, I figure if you can't poop and make all of our horrible noises in there, where can you?

399,"Oh, where do I start? I don't even know if my IBS can fit into one category anymore. I've had IBS since I was eight, but I wasn't 'officially' diagnosed with it until I was 22. In the beginning I had IBS-D with severe cramping. It stayed that way for most of my life.I've tried most of the medications out there and the best I had at one time was Zelnorm. Sadly, many of us did well on that medication and then it was pulled. I was very fortunate to have teachers in school who were understanding about my problem and the job I've worked for the last 20 years has been equally understanding (some get frustrated when I miss work, but not all). I generally miss one to two days a month when I have a bad flare-up. I'm glad my job offers unpaid leave through FMLA, so I'm not penalized for missing work.About six years ago when I went off birth control so my husband and I could try to start a family and my IBS-D changed to where two or three days a week I would be constipated to the point that I was purposely eating my old trigger foods to get sick enough to go to the bathroom. My doctor suggested I start taking Ducolax before bed to see if that would help. I still had flare-ups every morning, but they would go away after I had a bowel movement, so I was functioning.On January 27th I ended up in the ER with appendicitis and they removed my appendix the next day. Now, almost three months later, I am firmly in the IBS-C category. I have pain and bloating daily and occasionally I get nauseous and have the sweats like I'm running a fever. Right now, I'm going on day four without a bowel movement, even though I've taken Dulcolax and Miralax with no results.I'm 41 years old and I fear that I'm going to have to relearn how to deal with my IBS all over again. I'm planning on calling my doctor on Monday to go in and talk to him, as I feel we may have to change my meds yet again. It gets so frustrating living with this condition.

The pain became more and more frequent and doctors were telling me it may be neurological.I had a severe bout of pain years later that made me go back to the doctors to get more tests. They said I had an ileus and my gallbladder was functioning at eight per cent. They removed it and I kept having symptoms. I at first was severely constipated and the pain would wake me up. I often considered going into the ER. I actually went to the ER one day and they did a CT scan and said I was just constipated.I went to my gastro and had a myriad of tests: upper GI, colonoscopy, MRI, found nothing.

402,"I am 71 and generally in great shape and with decent energy. I had a prolapsed uterus and had a minimally invasive hysterectomy where my uterus and fallopian tubes were removed and my 'dropped' bladder suspended. The anesthesia was very constipating. I had no problems urinating post-surgery, but the discomfort of constipation caused my greatest recovery pain.I had previously struggled with IBS for years and cleared it up with acupuncture. My bowels had been pretty regular with occasional help from a strong probiotic (which we keep refrigerated) from Whole Foods. My 82-year old husband also found the probiotics helped to keep him regular.Back to my post-surgical reality. My health-minded daughter-in-law brought me several constipation-fighting products after my surgery, one of which was Smooth Move Tea which stimulates peristatic action to move the bowels. I had tried Miralax and 5mg of Dulcolax pills and nothing happened.The only commercial treatment that relieved constipation was Dulcolax suppositories, another remedy recommended by my surgeon. One suppository worked like magic with no pain or drama, but I did not want to become habituated to them.Finally, the night before my two-week check-up I decided to try the Smooth Move (senna) tea. I consume lots of decaffeinated teas. I always leave the mugs of tea on my counter to steep and by the time I got back to it, the tea was a strong, pleasant brew.The next morning, I awoke to the cramps described by so many other contributors who have taken senna. Like them, I thought I might die and yet they did not lead to a BM. My pain was more like labor contractions, especially painful because I was full of...well, you know, which causes its own discomfort.I knew I couldn’t drive to my appointment and I took one of the narcotic painkillers I left the hospital with (they were no help with the pain at all). I had avoided those because of their constipating effects. I called an Uber and told the driver to pull over midway so I could vomit, outside the car. I also was tempted to go to an emergency room, but toughed it out.My doctor wasn’t worried about the cramping and noted that I was in good shape after the surgery. Once I got home I used my last Dulcolax suppository and finally my bowels moved and moved. The pain of this experience lasted several days – probably because of the surgery. I still worry that the contractions damaged the bladder suspension, but time will tell.I continued drinking copious amounts of water, eating ruffage (salads, veggies, legumes and fruit) and taking high doses of magnesium, vitamin C and regular doses of probiotics. I finally could have normal BMs some of the time, but any deviation from this protocol and I become constipated.

407,"Well my story all began four years ago. Living in a town 30 miles away from work (due to the cost of living near my new job being too high) I had my initial meeting with IBS. There was a lot of stress at the time, my wife (just married) hated where we lived and so did I.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));It all started innocently enough. I had a Chinese takeaway - they never did sit well with me but my wife loved them so I let her have her way, boy do I wish that I hadn't. I was in agony, not having a clue what it was and getting scared when it didn't go after three days. I thought I had food poisoning. I went to the doctor, a very impatient ex-army doctor who was more interested in me being overweight than giving a damn about my stomach cramps and loose stools.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));Almost as suddenly as this began, it stopped, and I was OK. I put it down to experience (dodgy takeaway!) and moved on. Three weeks later it was back, and for no reason that I could tell. My symptoms lasted for a year this time, right over Xmas (which was the worst I had ever had).I saw an emergency doctor on Boxing Day 1999 who sympathized but didn't have a clue. I even went to accident and emergency, and saw a very young doctor who gave me some Gaviscon and sent me home. Two days of sitting on the toilet doing the IBS prayer (a special prayer for the digestively-challenged!

Yes, the millennium. In desperation I tried my Dad's remedy (for everything from a toothache to a flat tyre) of Kaolin and Morphine. That did seem to ease it and I can remember sitting in an armchair at my wife's gran's house tasting the horrible taste in my mouth wondering when I would be high enough on the morphine!After Xmas I decided that I had to get away from where we lived. I started a new job in the September of that year meaning I could move back to an area we knew. Things did seem to get a bit better (slowly) and I was not in as much pain. Slowly but surely I started to go to the pub with my team at lunch time, I even dared myself to try a Guinness! Heaven for 15 minutes, hell for three days! But by the November I was OK again, almost back to my pre-IBS days.My wife fell pregnant in the January (hooray!) and things looked great. Then I had another attack, June 2001. Stupid of me. I had eaten fish and chips at lunchtime (very rare for me, but remember my tum was OK at the time) then felt a bit naughty and had a cream bun. I was OK if a bit stuffed.Then my wife met me from work - 'Let's go out for dinner!' she cried. 'Oh great' I said, but it wasn't long before I was the one crying. One large burger with all the trimmings later and I was sitting at 5am next morning with stomach cramps from Slough (er...I mean hell!). This attack lasted just three months, but they weren't the best three months ever, trust me.My son was born on the 28th September and my life changed totally, my IBS almost totally cleared up and apart from several small attacks (all my own fault, chocolate ice cream at the cinema, strong curries etc, how I miss curry!) I had been completely fine. Thought I was over it.Just to show how fine I was - I had moved jobs several times in this blissful period, bought a house, seen my parents through three knee 
operations (two for Mum, one for Dad in case you thought that my Dad was Jake the Peg or something!), seen my son develop dyspraxia, go through a bullying lawsuit (I was the victim!) in one job and also welcomed my new daughter into the world on the 7th April last year. I'd sorted out our finances, everything was just great.Then just before Xmas this year I tried some latte coffee with my French boss. It was delicious, I kept having it, every other day or so. All OK.Then I started getting more and more diarrhea, more slight cramps, nothing too bad but I was trying to lose weight (very successfully I might add) so put it down to hunger.Then I got more into my new job, Project Manager at a very large US-based automotive company, they are everywhere, blue oval? I found it was quite stressful; all the senior management blamed me for everything!Then my daughter contracted a stomach bug, I seemed to get it too. But much worse.Then whilst visiting a customer I was sitting at a hot desk when my bottom decided to see how fast it could make me run the 200 meters. Stomach cramps and an hour later I was on my way home to face a heady cocktail of diarrhea mixed with agony and large doses of embarrassment.At the beginning of my long and probably anesthetizing tale I had a very bad bout of food poisoning. It only lasted 24 hours but I was vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time. I have always thought that this was the cause of it but never been 100% sure. Has anyone else ever 'caught' IBS like this?I'd be glad to talk to any men around my age (29) who have had any experience. Women tend to suffer most from these types of things and I find that most groups do have a female bias (rightly so, they are by far the people who suffer the most frequently). However I find that dealing with my symptoms are particularly hard as I am the sole breadwinner for my young family, and if I don't work, I don't get paid!You know the thought of that makes my stomach hurt!

It reached its height after a year or so when any exercise made it far worse. A GP said 'definitely not irritable bowel syndrome'. I saw a consultant at a hospital and introduced myself with the phrase 'It seems to be a case of IBS'. He snapped back at me 'Don't tell me what I already have in front of me' - a note from the GP who had told me it was not IBS. This rather spoilt the interview.He prescribed mebeverine which produced no detectable effect. Neither did Colpermin peppermint oil capsules I had tried previously. Another consultant said 'Nothing to do with your diet' whereas a GP had blamed it on my diet. I guess such contradictions are typical of the problem.It was especially bad a few years ago, having been being quite painful just to step off the pavement. There was a marginal improvement over years. I suggested the only other antispasmodic listed in the BNF, alverine citrate. The pain was reduced almost immediately and I became far more comfortable, but it did not reduce other symptoms. I needed to take it at double the maximum recommended higher dose, so as a chemistry graduate, I wanted to look into its toxicology.I found little on the internet, as it is a UK product not apparently available in the USA. The manufacturer refused to send me any details or 
even references to original papers on the product. Nor would it send the details to a US citizen who tried to get details for me. I have found a 
limited amount of information on it, but feel it really should not be so difficult to obtain detailed information on any pharmaceutical.A GP suggested a tricyclic antidepressant which I refused. I have tried paroxetine and venlafaxine which have not caused any problems at all, maybe helping me to relax more easily, but they do not seem to have helped much with the problem itself.After nearly a year or so I stopped taking alverine citrate to see what happened. The pain did not return. The other symptoms such as bloating are rather less severe than in the past, but are still a real nuisance. Hopefully the slow improvement will continue, but I expect it to take years.My guess is that it is useless expecting a 'Zauberkugel' (magic bullet) from any drug for IBS (and probably for many other health problems). Drugs may help, but I guess many IBS sufferers would do much better if they could change their lifestyle. This is easier said than done in many cases.

As scary as an attack is and as frightening as it can be, keep going to work, having your social life and exercising.

Worrying and concentrating on the disorder are going to do nothing but put even more stress on your mind and body. it 
will negatively affect you and the people around you the more you worry and limit yourselfFind trigger foods that might set you off, or seem to correlate with attacks. For me I notice imported beers (loaded with preservatives) really give me aches, pains and dizziness. Onions, processed cheese, sour cream, fatty foods, candies, chocolates and sweets, as well as canned pasta (anything with a tomato sauce) tear into me as well, and eating one serving of them can literally handicap me for days. Yesterday I indulged and had a couple of beers, canned pasta and a hamburger for dinner, it was delicious, but 24 hours later I'm still paying with a very angry digestive system.As embarrassing as it can be try to release gas no matter where you are. It can be embarrassing and sometimes smelly but there's a reason your body is trying to get rid of it. I often think that if it's coming out like that, my body doesn't want it in there.I hope this helps some people, I know a lot of it is common sense but it has really helped me a lot. At work on my lunch breaks I make a healthy sandwich with fresh deli meats and margarine. When I eat out I usually go to a local sub shop that makes everything fresh (including the breads) so you know everything is without preservatives.I find cola and dark-colored sodas really irritate my guts to so I try to wash my food down with water or sprite, and juices can also bother me. These are my 'safe' foods, and in no way are they limited, there's still tons of options of things I can eat and still feel relatively healthy. I do 
have attacks during the week, but I only have a handful, and most of them are only a one-time deal, at the most I'll go three times then be done with it.These changes have positively helped me, I haven't had a sick day at work in months other than having the flu. My relationship with my girlfriend has blasted off again, we're going places and doing things, plus my eating healthier and better has influenced her as well to do the same, which makes going to alternative restaurants and shops much easier.Right now I am in the midst of an attack, but I can live with it.

The colonoscopy only showed internal hemorrhoids and the endoscopy showed the acid reflux and esophagitis. After the colonoscopy, I noticed I was starting to have problems going to the bathroom. I was constipated for a couple of days and then I would have a couple of days worth of diarrhea. I can't eat any type of beef (hamburgers, steaks), pork chops, chicken etc.Month after month I have been having cramps, running to the bathroom when I'm going out somewhere (when I am working I always have to visit the bathroom first). Besides cramps, my symptoms are: nausea, stomach pains, constipation/diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue. I have been drinking ginger ale like it has been going out of style.Well, last week when my symptoms got worse again, my boyfriend Jon (yes I'm gay) said enough is enough, called my GI doctor and got me an appointment. Finally today my doctor finally diagnosed me with IBS. I'm happy that I finally I know what is causing my bouts of constipation/diarrhea but I'm not happy that my doctor said that IBS medicine for men is only in the testing phase.Is there anything over the counter that I can take to get rid of this constant pain? I am willing to talk to anyone about this.E-mail David:[email protected]",,doctor,doctor,toilet,flux,email,constipation,pain,cramp,acid,couple
415,"After reading some of the postings on this site I can honestly say I share many of the same problems. I am a 23 year-old male. About two years ago I left my country (Australia) and moved to Mexico City to be with my girlfriend. Needless to say I ate like a pig when I first arrived. A week into my stay I got very sick. You know how the doctors are when the Westerners get sick in Mexico...'Oh, you have been overeating and you're not used to the food, take this anti-diuretic pill and you will be fine'.So I went back to my country for a while because after a month I was feeling worse than ever. Back in Australia my doctors prescribed me with drug after drug, all to no avail. So I bit my pride and came back to Mexico. I got sicker...and then sicker...and then some more. After losing almost 10 kilos in nine months I said enough was enough and I saw a gastroenterologist.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2']));So I had anendoscopy...stomach good...intestine good...the biopsy showed I had helicobacter bacteria...and so I began my treatment for that. However the complication arose because I left it incorrectly treated for so long and now I have irritable bowel syndrome.I'm sure I do not have to go into all the details about how my life has changed and how depressed I feel sometimes. I feel pathetic. Some days I wake up and I'm laying in bed and I can hear the gastric juices making endless noises (a sign that I'm up for about a week of chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea). Anything and I mean anything can trigger it - stress, the wrong food (no matter how careful I am), a vitamin pill...God...eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));So I began to develop other secondary symptoms because of the lack of proper nourishment...sores on my tongue (I have read in Chinese medicine that this is a reflection of the colon)...inability to get over colds fast, cramps in the upper part of my stomach (those are the worst, I cry for hours on end because nothing, not even painkillers, can stop them). Drained of all my energy, darkness under the eyes, blood in my stool sometimes.I have developed intolerances to many types of food and I fear I will never get my weight back. I am not a rich man and so seeing specialists every month is not an option for me. All the publicly available drugs like Dicetel have the opposite effect of calming my system down.I could sit here and type for hours on all the horror stories I have had, from the chronic diarrhea in public places to the 4am visits to the emergency room only to find out that they can't do anything for me.I have found some ways to control my symptoms. These are (and I hope someone else can be helped by these): stress management - eating smaller meals but divided throughout the day. Keeping a diary of what happens to help you find some kind of pattern in how your body works or reacts. A medication which is called Motilium (which helps slow down the rate of digestion so as to avoid diarrhea).A tea made from gyuaba leaves (to stop diarrhea or at least help slow it down a bit) and also echinacea to help my immune system. Yakult is too much in a delicate digestive system like mine, so I find acidophilus pills help restore my floral intestinal bacteria after a rough bout of IBS.These measures might seem a bit unorthodox but believe me they work. The horrible part is that there is no cure for IBS, only treatments to help the symptoms and lifestyle changes. I don't care if I am never 100% again, all I ask for is 75% so I can live my life without pain and so much stress.I want to say that there is also hope for people like us who suffer from this horrible type of pain. No-one could understand it unless they have had it. I don't ask for sympathy, in fact I want people to know that this will not stop my life. I will live to an old age without pain one day...E-mail Mark:[email protected]",,pain,drug,system,food,pill,left,email,people,kind,stress
416,"Been having a read of some of the tales on this site, both good and bad. Doctor diagnosed me with IBS about five years ago, and yes I agree it is a curse. What between having diarrhea and not being able to go and the bloating, life can feel pretty awful.Looking back I see the symptoms starting at about secondary school, cramps on the way to get the morning bus would mean running home (if I could run that is) just to spend 20 minutes in the loo.Anyhow the symptoms have just gotten worse over the years, although not as bad as some I've read about, and I feel sorry (if that's the right word) for them, and realize that perhaps mine isn't so bad after all.Just wanted to give some info though. Drinking 'soft' water seems to help me, as does eating junk food (McDonald's etc), avoid pizza though. Some veg seems to set it off and produce gas and a bloated feeling, mainly cauliflower and broccoli. Mushrooms really do upset things, but these add reflux to the equation (something else I suffer with, perhaps they're linked), but reflux and bloating/gas seem to give palpitations and sweats.Things usually settle a little if I holiday in a place I'm very comfortable with and with people I trust. In fact they settle so well sometimes that apart from cramps in the morning after coffee or tea or breakfast, about an hour after waking, they almost disappear.I guess I must be one of the lucky ones to not suffer so bad with this curse, but we all suffer in varying degrees.

417,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_4']));I can't recall the first time I was affected by IBS. I recall the first time it affected my life though. I was around 14, at my friend's house, and 
my stomach was hurting quite badly and I had the feeling that I just needed to go to the toilet. I made my excuses and got back to my house as soon as I could. I know prior to that I'd had bad stomach aches and diarrhea for around two years on and off, nothing major or drastic, certainly didn't have a major influence on my life.Over the years though it all got worse and worse and started to affect my life. I think a lot of it is to do with the fact that as you get older your diet gets richer and more varied, whereas at 12 spaghetti hoops are quite exotic. As time goes on, foreign food and alcohol become staples.I live in fear of pizza, it's my really bad trigger. Oh don't get me wrong, if it was only pizza I would be a happy man and not have missed many concerts, events, social gatherings and days off work due to this. No, pizza is just the monster in the closet for me, but he has all his little deathly minions as well, and if I knew their names I could tick them off as I smite them. I don't though, and that's the problem.Let me tell you about a typical IBS incident for me. Let's say midday I have a Big Mac, and around 6pm I will eat again. Around 8pm I will get the slightest little feeling in the back of my abdomen, and slowly that will grow. It may take till around 10pm or it may take till 2am, but the only way I can get rid of this (believe me the pain will be bad, but a funny pain) is by going to the toilet, and it is always diarrhea, which will last 30 minutes or so.I know it's over as I will urinate, it's odd, that's like my all-clear sign, I urinate, only for about 10 seconds, but that's it, it's like an exorcism 
that has gone well and is now over.I think because I have had this for around 23 years, the feeling among my friends went from concern, to familiarity, to them ignoring it, to now when you have my family having no sympathy at all, friends fed-up because I call off things or leave early, and all of them suggesting things that will cure it or help things. My wife's favorite is to take a Nurofen as it will stop the pain, I love her as she does try to help, but it doesn't and won't help.I have tried every form of pain relief over the years and if I had found one that had worked I would have stuck with it, similarly the tummy tablets, things that did seem to work no longer work, maybe my body just got immune to them.At the moment I am the most down about it than I ever have been.

418,"Seems I've had this for a few years. I think irritable bowel syndrome, gluten intolerance, celiac disease etc are all related. About 26 months 
ago I got a stomach bug while working under my car when the dog kicked up a bit of dirt from around his hut and caught me on the lip. About 30 minutes later I was sick.A week later a small notice was in the paper about a sudden increase in food poisoning cases in our area and not to use public swimming pools etc... I'd pasted out on the toilet a few times, by two weeks later I felt OK.About 20 months ago I got another bout after eating at a BBQ at a friend's place. Somebody (and I know who it was, like it seems it was intended, I can remember it so clearly) hadn't washed their hands before handling the cooked meat. I wasn't the only one to be sick. I got over this like the last bout in about two weeks.But the bouts of constipation/diarrhea stayed. I thought that it was a bug in my stomach because after eating I would swell up and feel terrible. I was traveling by car to work (two days travel - one to three weeks work - two days travel), eating lots of McDonald's on the way.About this time I started to find there was a connection between food/stomach/sickness. Dad had been diagnosed with cancer six months before. I went to a doctor who took blood/feces tests, but when they came back negative they didn't bother to tell me. Did this about five times. Finally he said about IBS and how it can be induced with flour/gluten. So I tried a gluten-free diet.Gluten free was the way to go, my stomach stopped heaving all the time after about a week. After three days my indigestion disappeared. I'd been using Mylanta or Quickease everyday for about five years beforehand, haven't used it once since! So after about three weeks gluten free I was dismissed from work because of lack of work output and being sick all the time (fair enough). I still felt bad but I felt better than I felt before.Anyway this was about 12 months ago. The doctor did a IGa and IGg gluten test about six to seven weeks after I'd given up gluten, then upon my next visit proudly told me I was OK because the test came back negative. He never called up with this info and never told me you have to have a high-gluten diet for at least three months before taking the test for it to come back with a positive.

Then the explosive diarrhea events started. Mostly at night, or after a rich meal at a restaurant. Also on business trips. I got decent relief with Librax, but I had to take it 5-10 days to stop the event and it zoned me out bad. The cramps were so bad I yelled out in pain. The doctors, as many of you know, don't know squat.As of now, I am now in the 'constipation phase', however, I am controlling it nicely. I have some tips that may or may not help.Take two Citrucel tabs after every meal, and a glass of the powder form at night. Soluble fiber is the key. It relieves the constipation and eases the cramps when they come. Remember, it takes time for your colon to adjust and become regular again. It took me three weeks before I got consistent relief.Cut out all caffeine except for one to two drinks at your 'good time', the least likely time of an attack.Don't smoke!Stop drinking altogether, or only drink after a light, bland meal. Never ever after a heavy fat laden meal.Absolutely do not combine caffeine, dairy, or acid causing foods.Eat regularly during the day when you are active, and eat bland foods in small portions at night.Only eat fat-rich foods when you are active.Drink water all day long.

I've been through so many tests and all the doctors say is I have IBS and GERD (reflux). It sucks, it affects my life, my relationships, my friendships. I feel like I'm dying and have cancer or something. I seriously prepare to die sometimes because I feel like I'm being eaten out from the inside by an alien or something.My symptoms are getting worse as time goes on. My reflux disease goes hand in hand with the IBS. Whatever I don't regurgitate back up after eating, comes out in the form of severe discomfort. I manage to go to work, do what I can when I can.

During the journey I suffered excruciating stomach pains and had to make several stops.

My symptoms seem to worsen if I know I'm going somewhere where there may be no toilet or if there is a long (more than half an hour, ha ha) journey involved, and in the mornings.I used to drive a van around England for my job as a crane engineer and would have to carry my emergency kit (change of pants, bin bags, baby wipes, toilet roll) in the back in case I got stuck in traffic - it was like my own porta-loo which would be heaven to some people.

425,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));About 10 years ago I noticed a change in my digestive process. I was 33 at the time and never in my life had any issue in this area if you know what I mean. I noticed that I would have to go to the bathroom shortly after eating, several times a week. This was especially fun when I was commuting from NJ to NY via the train and subway where bathrooms are either disgusting or non-existent.I also began losing some weight, which several of my fellow workers commented on or joked about (they called me bubble boy or bug boy and suggested that since I visited the restroom so much they would move my computer to the handicap stall for efficiency). After several months of this I saw my GP who did a stool test, checked for blood and said she could not find anything and that I should see a specialist.I then sought out a gastro guy who took a history, ran the same stool tests and said that he thought it was nerves but that to appease me, he 
would do a colonoscopy which turned out to be fine (ie: no problems detected). As my symptoms got worse and I lost more weight (25 pounds) I got desperate and sought the advice of the one doctor I would trust with my life, my wife's OBGYN. She sent me to a specialist in NY City who took a history and ran a bunch of blood tests. He discovered that I had giardia and put me on very heavy duty antibiotics. Further tests revealed that the giardia was eradicated but I still did not feel well.After several more months, more aggressive tests were taken. I had additional colonoscopies and endoscopies, CTs, and sonograms which revealed that I had H. pylori. This entailed more heavy duty antibiotics to eradicate the infection. While a follow-up endoscopy several months later revealed that the infection was cured, I still felt bad.That is when I was told that I may have IBS. After a year and a half of tests, drugs etc they tell me that I have this condition. The problems that this caused in my personal life (marriage) were substantial. I was not the best patient during this time and my wife got tired of listening to me complain. My doctor thought that my condition was causing me to be depressed (who wouldn't be after all this) and I agreed to speak with a therapist. This turned out to be a waste of time since I acknowledged that I was depressed but that I would get undepressed if I felt I was getting better, to which he did not have a response.It has now been approximately 10 years since the outset of my condition. And while I am better now than when the two conditions above were present, I still have many of the symptoms (diarrhea, bloating, etc). I have learned to just deal with the condition and not let it control my life. Luckily it is not as bad as some of the stories I have read and can be largely controlled with common sense.I normally get a little bit of a warning as to when it will flare-up and I ensure that a bathroom is near. I never discuss it with my wife because I know she does not want to hear it and there would not be much point to it (no sympathy there). Sometimes weeks go by and I feel great and almost forget that I have this issue. Then I eat a meal or for whatever reason it flares up and I spend some time in the bathroom.I just try and live my life and enjoy it as best I can. If I eat a nice meal and some wine and it results in a bathroom break so be it. I am not going to eat some benign diet my whole life. That is no way to live. I carry Imodium with me at all times and use it when I need for the symptoms to stop (not near a bathroom). Otherwise I let it rip so to speak.I am not sure this story will help anyone or not but here it is. If I had one message it would be to seek out as much medical diagnosis as you can stand or afford. You may find out you have something else and then can deal with that. Once you have done that you can try and learn to live with it as best as you can, enjoy the good times that life offers and manage the down times as best as possible.E-mail John:[email protected]",,toilet,exam,condition,husband,medical diagnosis,email,endoscopy,antibiotic,infection,doctor

He said 'Well, Josh, you know, if it doesn't make you feel better, you'll be happier about being sick'.So I tried it. It did help tremendously when coupled with 2 to 4mg of loperamide every day.

In my case I know what set it off - I contracted a bug which was in the water supply (cryptosporidium) which gave me many food poisoning-like symptoms. As a result I have been left suffering with severe IBS.The depressing thing is as a result of me not being able to control it I lost my very good job, my girlfriend and the last year of my life, as of most of the last year it had made me housebound. I have a great GP and I have also been under the care of a few gastro specialists. I have had all the tests to rule out anything else.Even now, two years after I was ill, the effects on my body are devastating, and it's got so bad that my body always feels like I need to go to the loo even when I don't need to, and even when I do it's of a loose nature. I have been seeing a dietician and a physio, and although this has helped, things just have not significantly improved. I of course avoid all things that worsen my IBS - certain foods, etc.I can have my very good days when I take my medication. On my good days I get about three to six bowel movements, and then there are my bad days where it has honestly been as high as 15-plus or I am just stuck on the loo for hours. At one point I was even sleeping in the bathroom because of the worry of soiling myself by not getting there in time! A colonoscopy revealed that my bowels were very sore, and this is due to the frequency of bowel movements.My movements definitely do increase if I get stressed, but it's hard not to become stressed when this is so much of a burden on my life. It's not just the severe diarrhea; on some occasions I have been hit with chronic constipation (fecal impaction is a term they also used). I have spent over a month in hospital this year alone due to this problem. The worst time was when I was unable to have a bowel movement for over three weeks!Medication I have taken, or am currently taking, include: loperamide, mebeverine, amitriptyline, colifoam, tramadol, citalopram, zopiclone, canesten, paracetamol, Buscopan, ompeprazole, diclofenac, Movicol, Senokot, Fybogel, Cirtafleet (if severely constipated), and Forti-sip food replacement drinks. Then there are also the fluid replacement sachets I take to try and prevent dehydration.As you can see quite a list, and all of this has been prescribed by either my GP, specialist, or hospital management pain team. My days just seem to be filled with taking medication, but if I don't then things get all the worse.I try to take a positive outlook and hope that things will eventually improve. If there was any kind of surgery on offer I certainly would have it 
done. I have to manage my IBS on a daily basis, and mix the medication to match how I am feeling that day (of course staying within the daily dosages). I see my GP regularly to assess everything.If you have any questions just ask, or if you wish to share your stories with me then please do.E-mail Daniel:[email protected]",,medication,people,email,tale,food,body,expert,Hospital Management,water supply,food poisoning
429,"I almost had a panic attack two weeks ago. I went to eat Chinese food in Chicago with my friends. I promised myself that I would never leave any kind of food just because of this damn sickness. So after we ate we went to the park to see a Chinese festival.All of a sudden, I felt something and I thought it was gas. I was wrong, and I almost had an 'accident'. Because I didn't have a bathroom nearby I started to feel very anxious and desperate. I was trying not to think about it by counting candies or cars or saying 'This is my body, I know that's nothing' but it did not work. I was about to start running but all of a sudden my cramps left, but I still felt nauseous and had a lot of adrenaline.Coming back from Chinatown the traffic was very intense and I felt trapped. I started to breathe heavily, feeling desperate and getting crazy with the noises in my stomach and the cramps. I was thinking 'Get out of the car and run'. After counting to 1000 everything vanished and the traffic started to move.I never had that symptom before, and it was maybe the worst thing that has happened with this damn sickness. But also I realized that with a lot of concentration the sickness can be fought. Since then, every day I say to myself 'I'm stronger that this sickness, I will do my errands even if I have an accident!'My symptoms are the same, but now I can make myself think about something else, or at least make my body wait to find a bathroom, telling myself that there is nothing I can do but wait. I also say this to myself: 'What will happen if I have an accident, people are not going to see me again' or 'What's the worst that can happen if I'm late, if I lose my job, I can get another one, or if I miss a class, I can explain to my teacher what happened'.Making things look simple is working for me. It is hard but I'm seeing improvements, little by little. Let me know about you.

430,"I am 21 years old and I have had IBS since I was nine or 10. I thought for many years that I simply had a weak stomach that could not handle certain foods. All through middle school and high school I fought with this silent syndrome with no help from my parents or the medical community. I was trapped! My parents would joke that every time I came into the house they knew where I was going...(everyone who has IBS knows where this is going)...right to the bathroom!I'd have the worst cramps followed by diarrhea and a pain that I can only describe as blinding. I am not kidding when I say I was in so much pain I wouldn't be able to see. Everything was foggy.Finally when I went to college my symptoms culminated. I go to a nursing school so one day I finally went to the hospital where they ran tests and found no 'problems'. I knew I had to take things into my own hands! I found a GI on my own and was finally diagnosed with IBS. I wish this was the end and I lived happily ever after...negative! I am still suffering every day!I've gone through two GIs, as let's just say we did not get along! I wanted to be proactive instead of reactive. Meaning I'd like to be able to take medicine instead of having to go to the ER to get relief. I go to the hospital about once a month or every other month for IV's because I get so dehydrated from diarrhea. I am currently on Zofran for nausea, Levsin for cramps and an antacid for gastritis which I've recently been diagnosed with! IBS and gastritis! I know I don't have Crohn's but damn my symptoms have a scary resemblance to it.I am captain of my college baseball team and I have been wrestling with the issue of having to quit because of losing 20 pounds in three months and no end in sight.

431,"I've had random attacks of IBS since my sixth birthday. I used to spend perhaps three hours cumulatively during the day, just sat on the toilet, because when I'd thought I'd finished and got to the bathroom door, I'd have to rush back. I always used to joke that 'number twos come in twos'. Now, 23 years on, each attack comes in threes or fours.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Every two years I'd see a GP or a doctor and be told like the rest of you were told that 'It's all in your head'. By the time I saw the sixth, it took a tremendous amount of restraint on my part having heard those five infuriating words, to not strangle him to death with his own stethoscope as I said 'It's all in your head' to his purple bloated face.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));If it were just the diarrhea or soft stools (often covered in mucus) it wouldn't be as bad, but the pain is akin to turning one of those electric abdomen belts up to full power whilst trying to have a bowel movement. Sometimes I want to reach in through my abdomen and rip out my intestines because I know it would be less painful than enduring the rest of the attack. I've heard that some women have likened severe IBS to childbirth but over and over again. I've had two bouts that were so severe that I vomited suddenly whilst sat on the toilet.The lack of sympathy from family and friends used to be an issue but thankfully and with my eternal gratitude they're now much more understanding, but I know that they're frustrated and I don't blame them, and I don't even get asked to events anymore because 'He's got that stomach thing!' If the pain I felt two hours ago before I hunted the 'net looking for help could be transferred into someone that's never had it simply by touching them, then they'd collapse on the floor screaming for their mothers and demanding an ambulance because 'they're dying'. I just sat on the toilet and quietly shed a couple of tears.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I have no life at all and this has led to depression, I haven't been able to have a holiday/vacation for over 10 years because I can't do with the drive to the airport, the wait there, and the flight. Nor can I take more than a 20 minute drive to any destination without knowing that there's a toilet on the route. Which reminds me of a tale I heard from someone that bought a van, so that when they were 'caught out' they could pull over, go into the back of the van and do their business with nobody waiting. If I want to go anywhere over 20 minutes, that's what I'm going to have to do, too.And Mrs Right has been and gone, because I couldn't go anywhere with her or spend the time with her that she deserved and I became snappy and cruel at every suggestion and comment she made. I felt it best that we end the relationship because she had no life either. I haven't had a partner since, six years ago almost to the day, because it would just go the same way.It sounds awful and please don't be offended or think that I'm being vile and repugnant because for some of you IBS is just a nuisance and for others they can sympathize with me entirely, but this is something that has affected my family too, but if a person has cancer, they either get cured and go on to enjoy life, or they die within a couple of years if they're 'lucky' enough to live that long, but they don't have to feel that pain anymore and suffer its debilitating effects.But we, as IBS sufferers, are supposed to live with this excruciating pain on a weekly (and in my case daily) basis and keep our mouths shut for decades? Sorry, but I'd rather have a terminal illness, IBS of this magnitude is a fate worse than death. If a doctor told me 'There's a drug that'll get rid of your IBS, but you'll be dead within 10 years' then I'd rejoice and take it because at least I'd have a full and rich life for those few years, doing everything I've missed like birthdays, my nephew and nieces' school plays, parties, jobs that I'd love but can't have because I'll need the toilet every few minutes, a wife, children of my own, traveling, the theater, pretty much everything. I can't have any of that.I've tried everything that's been suggested including exclusion diets, stress management, exercise, specialist consultants earning hundreds of thousands every year. All except the hypnotherapy, so I'm going to buy the CDs linked on this site and I'll let you all know if I have any success with it. There's nothing left to try after that, other than accept I'm going to live the rest of my life as I have done since I was six; in pain, alone, and empty.Update on David...Back on February 14th, I submitted a tale. I'd had IBS for years and it had ruined my whole life, whether it be love life, work life, or otherwise. I'd decided to give the IBS audio course a try, and although it didn't reduce the pain or frequency, it did make me think differently about the condition. I accepted that IBS just happened and there was little I could do about it, so rather than worrying about it and it being on my mind all the time like an obsession, I finally began to focus on other things, accepting the IBS. Though, sometimes, the pain would still be incredible.I did the course for about a month. I'd never been more than two days without IBS and that was only about once a month. But at the start of June, I noticed I had been three days without, which turned into four days, which turned into a week, then a month, and now four months and not a hint of it.I can't believe it. It felt bizarre at first, and I kept thinking it was too good to be true. But as time went on, I started to just feel better and better, because I was finally in control. People noticed the change in me and that spurred me on further. I've even completely changed my image and my wardrobe and I'm planning a holiday in France. Yes, a holiday! With a 60-minute trip to the airport and a two-hour wait and a two-hour flight, all without having to worry about where the nearest toilet is!The only hard part was realizing how much of my life I'd lost to the IBS, and what I'd missed out on. But I've got my life back on track and can finally get back to living. The only good thing to come out of having IBS is that it taught me to appreciate life and the world, and I'll be doing a lot more with my life than I would have done, had I not had it.So maybe it was the audio course, or maybe it just went away of its own accord, I don't know. But I'll tell people to do the course because it helps in lots of ways. I really hope that this gives hope to people who have IBS, whether mild or chronic, and I'd considered myself to have had one of the more severe cases, so there's hope for everybody.

432,"I'm a 29 year-old from Bristol, England, and I have had IBS since I was about 14. It affected me quite badly when I was at school, but then seemed to ease off when I left school. I had a pretty care-free few years up until I was about 22 when it all started again.A point in my life triggered the IBS again and got me thinking about it all the time. One particular incident was when I was on the motorway, when I got stuck in an eight-hour traffic jam and started thinking to myself 'What if I need the toilet?' Well, soon after that I did, I had to do the only thing I could do, I had to go at the side of the motorway, but luckily there was a big field so no-one could see me. Since then I hate driving on motorways, and I just hate driving in general just in case I have another bout.Things these days are still quite bad, I think about my stomach all the time and it just drives me mad. I just get so jealous of the 'normal people' out there.I have just started a diet and fitness program which seems to be helping a bit, cut out all the fatty foods, cut right down on alcohol, do some form of exercise every day, but I think until I get the thoughts of IBS out my head it won't fully get back to normal.

433,"I have had IBS for a while now, and I have been rushed to the emergency room many times. On top of that, I also have acid reflux disease and a sinus arrhythmia (my heart skips a beat). I have found out that I am partly lactose intolerant, but that doesn't cause my stomach pain.Countless hours have been spent crying and in a suicidal state from this disease, but there is a product that helps me a lot. It is called Activia. That stuff literally works miracles. I take it once every day for a month. I'm not a spokesman for them or anything, but it truly does help your system to regulate.

I have also found out that Tylenol doesn't work much, at least for me, but you and I are made different so it may be worth a shot.

434,"I have suffered periodically from IBS for 15 years. It began after I was working in South Africa when I was wrongly diagnosed with typhoid and prescribed double doses of chloramphenicol by a doctor who I now know to be a scoundrel! My work took me all over the world, but due to IBS I can no longer tolerate long-distance flights. (I have been told by cabin crew that they are advised not to fly if they are suffering an IBS attack.)My symptoms can last for a few days to several months, with a 14-month attack by far the longest. I've virtually given up trying to work out why it happens and, having tried a host of prescribed drugs, am still no wiser as to which one helps - if any! One thing I've constantly had from doctors, GPs and specialists alike, is 'Are you stressed?'

435,"Well, where to start...I've been suffering from IBS for five years, ever since I had an operation on a fistula.

He asked why I couldn't go out on delivery and I had to explain the constant tummy pains, the one-minute early warning to rush to the loo, why I couldn't ride a bike because half the time it feels like my back end is hanging out due to the amount of times I've had to pass a nice sloppy stool which made my piles grow like button mushrooms or if I was lucky one or two might burst to relieve the pressure.

436,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Although diagnosed by my GP as having IBS about five years ago, I've not read about many people with symptoms very like mine, so I'm writing partly to see if there's anyone out there like me! Also because it might help me to share these difficult experiences. It all began in about 1995 when I noticed I could no longer go regularly in the morning and everything got a bit explosive when I did finally go.I began to get some mucus and (disgusting!) this began to leak a bit between bowel movements so I was having to wash my trousers a lot. I was having about five or six BMs a day but often felt I had not really finished - apparently this is typical. Plus loads of wind building up especially in the afternoons - often I would be OK in the mornings but bloated and windy later.None of this has really changed much despite so many treatment attempts and dietary changes. I still have around six BMs a day, more like eight to ten on bad days, and end up with stomach ache almost every afternoon. At work it is worse because it is harder for me to visit the loo as often as I need to. After 5pm I usually sit on the loo for quite a while to try to offload the unfinished business!In 2005 I ended up rushed into hospital with bleeding piles because of the wear and tear on my backside. My GP finally referred me for sigmoidoscopy and the results were a bit ambiguous - some general irritation and odema (fluid retention) and a small polyp were found. But a later colonoscopy gave me the all-clear, and they couldn't find the polyp this time! Reassuring or what? Still, if it had been serious I would have popped my clogs by now.I've tried most of the UK treatments going, I reckon, and consider only Fybogel to have been of any use, and that only slightly. As I fluctuate between IBS-C and D, it is not easy to see what to do. Treatments that try to adjust the prebiotic or probiotics in my gut are hopeless for me, they give me diarrhea and even worse wind. That includes Regucol from Holland and Barrett, which also gave me sharp stomach pains. Terrible stuff! As did mebeverine. Peppermint oil capsules seemed to help years ago but don't anymore.I do take a small dose (20mg daily) of the anti-depressant amitriptyline, officially because it reduces stomach ache, but really it just makes me feel more relaxed and focused. I was once diagnosed as moderately depressed but don't think I am now. However I am quite easily worried by things, especially work, so of course everyone says 'It's all in the mind...'I've also been under the care of a nutritionist, going as far as a strict exclusion diet in 2007, followed to the letter. The trouble was, the exclusion diet contained too little fiber for me, so I ended up far worse than on my usual diet, blown up and constipated. So that had to be abandoned. If there's one thing I know regarding my diet, it's that I need a lot of good old-fashioned roughage, and the advice towards soluble fiber doesn't suit me. Porridge gives me acid indigestion, and if I don't have plenty of whole meal and bran flakes I soon start to blow up like a balloon, and spend half the day on the loo passing a lot of mucus and not a lot else.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I also get a horrible 'upwards pressure' feeling when constipated, which is a bit like breathlessness and is presumably caused by my colon being full under my diaphragm. If I get this at night in bed, I can be close to panic and have to do slow breathing. For this reason I stick to the bran flakes - I'd rather keep my problems at the bottom end rather than in the middle, if that makes sense.As dietary changes have been so unhelpful, I just try to eat healthily in general, ie: plenty of drinks, fruit and veg, and hardly any fried food. Because I drink a lot of water and weak tea, I also pee for England, but I think that my IBS also upsets my bladder.I do have one or two theories about what really caused my IBS, but won't bore you with that yet. If anyone's even read this far...But stress isn't the cause, or at least not stress in the short term. On holiday, and on quiet days at work, my IBS can be just as bad. It seems to be much more continuous than other people's - although I have some worse days, it's always present. I haven't lost weight or suffered bleeding (apart from piles) so I still have a lot to be thankful for. I'd love to know if anyone has experiences similar to mine, and can shed any light on possible solutions/improvements.Update on Jim...This is a somewhat sad postscript to my IBS experiences. I've now found out that I should have paid more attention to my bladder and prostate health. It began last December with me noticing how difficult it was to pee properly - I put it down to the cold weather! But when my employer offered a PSA test as a part of a men's health week, I went along. The result was 6.4, far too high for a 51 year-old (it should be about 2.2).To cut the story short, a prostate biopsy in March showed no signs of cancer, thankfully, but did show prostatitis (inflammation). Not so bad then, but scans and a urodynamics test (urine flow, pressure etc) also showed I was emptying my bladder very poorly, in fact hardly at all sometimes. Yet weirdly, my prostate is not showing up as being enlarged as it does with many old men. My consultant at first said he would have to operate to clear any blockage, but is now backtracking in view of the risks to my sexual abilities at my young(ish) age, and is trying drugs first - more in hope than expectation, he admits. So I'm a bit in limbo for three months, trying a drug combination that my consultant admits probably won't work.As I still have my IBS just as before, six to seven BMs a day and plenty of diarrhea and wind, together with the need to empty a stubborn bladder as well, you can imagine that my loo and I spend a lot of time together! In fact we do get a bit bored with each other's company. What's more, my latest medication (tamsulosin plus dutasteride) seems to make my diarrhea worse. I'm trying the plant-based supplements saw palmetto and quercetin too (with my doctor's knowledge) because I'm trying every way to avoid surgery, but I suspect my urinary symptoms are too severe, and there's always that fear of acute urinary retention (seizing up altogether).Work is quite a strain now because these problems leave me so tired and I often sleep poorly. If anyone has any experience of coping with IBS combined with urological/prostate problems, do let me know, including dietary tips. I understand that links between IBS and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (prostatitis) are discussed in the literature.Moral of the story? If you have bladder symptoms as well as IBS, don't just assume there's no physical problem there, even though you've been told just that many times about your bowels.E-mail Jim:[email protected]",,diet,wind,treatment,stomach,job,people,drug,bran,flake,adviser
437,"I am 42 and I have been bothered by the symptoms of IBS-D since about 2004. I have only been diagnosed with IBS for the last year. My symptoms are not as bad as other people's, but they are still life-altering. I generally only have a problem about an hour after waking up. If I don't have an attack by 10am I am usually fine for the entire day. I can also go for a period of time with no problems, then suddenly get plagued harshly and daily.A couple years ago I took a tour trip of England. I was still in the pre-diagnosis stage and I was constantly looking for restrooms and biting back much pain. It was so bad on that trip that I did some damage and started bleeding. Fortunately that led to the full colonoscopy tests and it was with great relief that I was finally diagnosed as having IBS and acid reflux.I have had several prescription medications, the last being Lomotil, which gave very mixed results. My doctor was concerned with the addictive properties of it, so I have recently been using the Imodium tablets instead. My doctor also told me I could take the Imodium proactively as I am in a job field requiring daily travel to customer locations. It generally works for me, and usually only one tablet is enough, though some days I need as many as six to control the problem.I take Prilosec for the acid reflux. I have also been slowly identifying which foods are my trigger foods. I know chocolate is one for sure, and tea (which I love) is another. Something in Chinese food also seems to set me off. Like others who write you, I find myself looking at food and wondering if I can safely eat it. I find if I go out to eat, I don't want to do anything after but get home to a restroom, just in case. I carry Imodium with me everywhere and I even have baby wipes in my tool bags to help clean up. I also find that if I eat in the morning I do have an attack, so I normally avoid any breakfast and have a late lunch. I will not eat for at least 10 hours before I have to fly anywhere either.Until I found this site I really thought I was alone in this. I hadn't heard of anyone suffering as I do. When my doctor told me I have IBS, he didn't really provide me much information about what I could do to reduce the outbreaks. Everything was very general. I have been so embarrassed, I have been late and missed meetings, both business and personal, due to attacks. I have felt alone in all of this, afraid to get back out into the dating world for years - how do you explain to a date you are having a medical issue? I am normally a pretty upbeat person, but IBS has brought about depression at times, and a general feeling of hopelessness.After reading your site, it was reassuring to see comments from people who have been living with IBS for years and have learned to bring it under control. I went ahead and ordered The First Year - IBS recommended here. I signed up for your mailing list - just knowing that I am not alone in this gives me a sense of optimism and hope.

438,"I have lived with IBS for 22 years. The first knife in the colon experience left me breathless and crying. I was the tough bully beating-up kid of the school. Large and in charge. Over the years like water over a rock it took my strength until the spasms and malnourishment took all I had. At 20 I peaked at 215lb, with lots of weight training, and then after a severe episode of IBS I was down to 135lb, the same weight I was at age 12. I was a walking stick and ended up in the ER one morning after nearly dying from it. I still think modern medicine doesn't understand the risks of this disease/disorder.Since the 135lb days I have journeyed all over this earth in search for a cure. SCD, probiotics, you name it. All I know is that after having pneumonia at 11, I was 'saved' by horse pills, shoved you know where. Six months later IBS was now my lifelong partner. One day I hope to kill him.

I have just been fired from my job because I was on the toilet at home and couldn't go to work due to too much pain (I made sure they knew I couldn't turn up in the morning but could do afternoons). I was only at that company a week and I put on the application that I have problems.I am able to work, just not at allocated times or days which no comapany/business wants. I am very smart when it comes down to important things and I am very useful when working as I love work. I have qualifications and I am a home student at the moment with Luton college, but studying is constantly put on hold because other things pop up. I have experience in all sorts of things, from hairdressing, catering, gaming, horticulture, warehouse and warehouse management, the list goes on.I am normally on the toilet for rarely a minimum of two hours to normally a maximum of about four or five (and that's just going). This can be at any time of the day and can happen every day for a week. I always have to wash the area afterwards and sometimes I have to rest when finished to not cause more discomfort or pain.The only person who understands my problem is my girlfriend, which I am very grateful for. My mum is constantly having a go at me because I can't work and she blames me for a lot of things. I have several different groups of friends who in a weird way ask if I want to go out basically at the same time as each other and I don't know what to do, and then my mum keeps asking me to do this and that for her (mainly when I'm on the toilet and she asks me to run down to the shop before it closes in like 30 minutes, but I can't so she gets irritated with me).It makes me very depressed and on a daily basis I just think about ending it all. I constantly worry about eating and I have thought about giving that up. I am always worried about what people think of me and whenever I'm around them and my stomach is playing up and I start having flatulence I worry if I smell because of this.I honestly can't do my life any more and I just wish I wasn't born. IBS has destroyed my life since 2008 and it only seems to get worse. I have to stop every job I do, even volunteering, and I quit hairdressing at college in 2009. If I can get incapacity benefit it would mean a lot to me and maybe I could stop stressing out so much about money issues, getting shouted at and just general life.I am a really nice guy and easy to get along with (making friends is easy; it's just managing to keep 'em) but because people have problems with me having IBS and I try to work on that I get depressed. I may sound a bit big-headed but I am trying to put everything into the perspective of why I can't have a normal life.

440,"Hi. I'm a 57 year-old man. I'm a lorry driver and I have done this job for almost 27 years, it's long hours and nights away sleeping in the lorry. I have got a hiatus hernia and I'm on medication for that. I have also got Gilbert's syndrome which there is no treatment for other than to try and eat and drink the right things. And I have just been diagnosed with IBS and prescribed Fybogel which seems to sort out most of my stomach problems. It has been getting more of a problem as I get older.Driving lorries is very stressful which makes my symptoms worse and diet is also a problem along with lack of exercise. I'm glad that people are talking about their health problems as I felt alone.

No doubt how thrilled I was to add another ailment to my list of afflictions. I am grateful to run into support sites such as these to help me not feel alone. It is nice to hear other men's stories also. I think that it is important to know that you are not alone. Isolation occurs to often for all of us, and it tends to aggravate IBS, especially because it often comes from fear and anxiety.I have had IBS for about 16 months. At first, doing sit-ups or crunches would work the air through my intestine and relief would come in about 10 minutes. But now it has become so bad that that doesn't even work. I am dieting right (I think), but nothing seems to help.I grew up on a farm where if calves bloated from eating fresh alfalfa, they cram a tube down their throat or, if it became potentially lethal, they would puncture the stomach of the calf and the air would be able to escape. I sat in constipation mode today, on the toilet, after two hours of severe pain, wishing I had one of my uncle's puncturing devices.I looked at my bloated belly and could picture the air only centimeters away from my skin, and thinking how relieving it would feel to just 'poke' and let the air fizzle out kind of like a nail popping a tire. I even took a couple of 'test pokes' at my stomach to get a better idea of the pain 
involved. The pain of IBS drives you crazy! I was not just joking about the poking! I would not recommend it to anyone else though.Right now Pepsi and coke seem to be able to help. I am going to look into medication and all that stuff (and maybe a catheter to be installed into my intestine!) That would be nice! Whenever the pain is bad, just reach underneath the shirt and turn a little 'release' valve if you know what I am saying. Let all the air out. Instant relief. I may look into that. I'll call it GIERV: Gastrointestinal Emergency Relief Valve.

445,"I am 49 and have had IBS since my teen years. My family has some history of IBS, but I have always had it the worst. I was in a serious accident when I was 15 and hospitalized for three months. It was during this time that I had the first real bad attacks of IBS.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));Things calmed down in my gut until my early 30s. My wife had serious medical problems which caused a serious amount of stress in my early 30s and this set off the bad symptoms of IBS that I have suffered from ever since that time.I have gone to many top gastro doctors and none of them helped. They told me that this is not a life-threatening condition, but I was never worried about that anyway. I have the serious constipation form of the disease and I can go up to two weeks without having a bowel movement. Then, usually out of the blue (but it usually is related to eating), I'll get intense cramps.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));If I can't go to the bathroom on my own I will take an enema. It usually takes two to three hours and three to four Imodiums before I am finished. I usually feel better for a few days after that and then the cycle starts again.I have tried things like Konsyl, Citrucel, etc as well as various drugs such as Levsin, Donnatal, Bentyl, etc. I also avoid spicy foods, red meats, dairy products and stick to a very bland diet of turkey, chicken, potatoes, rice, tea, bread (but very little pasta), some fruit and vegetables and avoid sweets (even though I love sweets).eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));I have had episodes in my life where the IBS was under control and I functioned normally, but usually something happens that sets it off. For 
example, I was taking several tablespoons of Konsyl a day and having regular bowel movements over a period of three to four months.Everything was fine and then, all of a sudden, I started having terrible gas. I tried to adjust the amount of fiber and change to another brand, but nothing helped. I went off the fiber and the IBS came back.I have also found that regular exercise helps and this is good for you in any case. Clearly, avoiding mental stress is also important. I tend to agonize over things and that can set it off. Keeping a 'level head' is very important for those who suffer from IBS. But this is all 'easier said than done.'At this point, I am just alternating between constipation and severe cramps and long episodes in the bathroom. I am not happy about it, but I view the IBS as a disability I have to live with. People survive with much worse things.I try not to let the IBS stop me from doing things I want to do. For instance, when I was a teen I played in blues bands in high school and college, but stopped in my 20s. In my early 40s, I started playing again and got to the point where my band tours nationally. Two years ago, I drove cross country on a tour.

For as long as I can remember, until the age of 22 I would have to find a toilet and find it quick right after I ate. All of my friends knew this and if we went out to eat, we'd have to wait and stick around for a couple minutes before we left because I'd have to wait to feel that dying urge to empty my bowels.Anyway, from the age of 22 on (I'm now 25) I've been facing bouts of constipation and cramps and gas and it's just so unbearable at times.

450,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));I am a 39 year-old who has been diagnosed with IBS-C a little over a year ago. I was always constipated for as long as I can remember. 
I believe this is in part due to my own self-consciousness that I had as a child and a fear of sitting on the toilet. I had this fear because back when I was in grade school, the classrooms had a unisex bathroom in each classroom, and the door didn't lock, so there was no privacy whatsoever. So as a result I always suppressed my need to have a bowel movement during school, and just tried to go at home.This was the beginning of a long, ongoing problem that was going to get worse. To make matters worse, I had open heart surgery at the tender age of four years old, which I feel has contributed to this problem because of all the medications that were pumped into me, which caused me to be corked up. In my junior high and high school years the pain of constipation continued, again because of the suppression I had to exhibit. The stalls in the boys' bathrooms had no doors on them, so again there was no privacy.There was one day in junior high when I had to go so bad that I went to the boys' bathroom and pooped, but not before a fellow classmate walked in and saw me on the toilet. Needless  to say that kids are mean and I was ridiculed and teased for performing a normal bodily function. Anyway, I began to suppress my need to use the toilet. I was fine for a while after that, going about four times a day, but that was short-lived.At the age of 31 I had a second open heart surgery. Before my surgery I had an enema, which proved to be a cathartic experience but didn't help me afterward. I was in pain while I was recovering because I had a terrible time. Could not go if my life depended on it. I would be on the toilet every hour hoping for relief, but got only gas, and once (not to be gross) a small pellet came out, with lots of straining. After that, I began to gain weight, have abdominal pain, and always feel bloated. I disappear to the bathroom for at least 10 minutes, and I have been on the toilet for as long as an hour, in the hope of that ever-evasive bowel movement.This darn issue has affected me with things like my mood, work, and even my weight. I can start with my work, because as anyone knows, how do you explain to your boss that you have a bowel problem without being mortified afterwards? There have been jobs that I have lost because of using the toilet a lot. I cannot understand why employers are so heartless to people's medical issues. There have been times that I have the urge, go to the bathroom, and sit there in pain for what seems like an eternity, hoping for a super poop, only to pass gas.At the employer I currently work for, a manager accused me of using the bathroom as a library, because she found a magazine in there one time which didn't belong to me. This condition has affected my mood because when you have this miserable problem, you feel helpless and alone, and most of all chained to the toilet (because you never know when the constipation will let up and how).It also makes me feel jealous of people who do not even have to think about this. The people who I have had enough nerve to tell about it, reply to me 'Well, I go to the bathroom like clockwork'. And then the unsolicited advice begins. With this I get depressed and feel even worse. Every time I am on the toilet I think 'Is this what will be for the rest of my life?' It has also affected my weight (I have been overweight most of my life, maybe this is part of the reason). I feel like every time I do go to the bathroom, my bowels do not get completely emptied, and feel that I should sit there longer, but with no luck.My doctor diagnosed me last year and put me on Zelnorm, which worked for a while, but that too was short-lived. But as we all know, Zelnorm was pulled a couple of months ago. Now what, will there never be normal bowel movements in my future? I saw her last week, and she put me on this new drug called Amitiza. We will see what happens, and I will be seeing the doctor again later this month for a follow-up. Hopefully, there will be a happy tale to follow, sooner than later.If anyone who reads this wants to share your thoughts with me, you may e-mail me.

This is the really scary part for me, but here goes with my story...I have had IBS since I was 15. My mom and grandma suffer from it and my grandfather died of colorectal cancer in 1992. I thought it would be OK as when I used suppositories or milk of magnesia even, it would usually work.I am 25 now, and since January of this year it has gone from worse to impossible. I can't seem to have a bowel movement in the morning like I am used to (somewhat), no matter what I try. I use Bisacodyl suppositories that are prescribed and they don't do anything for me but give me a false urge.After days of not going I went to the ER. They said I didn't have a blockage and sent me home with some Golytely that is meant to clean you out before a colonoscopy. It worked but didn't give me diarrhea for that long, and I drank the whole gallon. Eventually just water came out.Now every day of my life when I wake up my heart races and I can't go because I'm so worked up with my PTSD and other issues on top of the physical problem. So I have taken the Golytley four times now in a month and a half just so I can go, but then I'm right back to being constipated. The problem is, I eat nothing but fiber and health food, and the next morning it's always the same...I'm so scared because I fear that this is going to kill me, I know they say you can go 10 days without a bowel movement, but I know my body and how much I'm supposed to go, and now it's just a struggle to get out a very teeny little bit, after hours of straining and suppositories...I don't know who else can help me or what to do, I've tried everything. Even the doctors don't know why I can't go with everything I try to do to go. I am currently awaiting an appointment with a specialist for a colonoscopy, but I am only 25, it would suck to have colon cancer like my grandfather at my age, which seems impossible. I don't know what else it could be, that would stop my colon from actually working and producing an urge and movement to go.I have gone two weeks without a bowel movement, and that's when I took the Golytely. IBS and chronic constipation is a very serious and very scary thing, especially for me, and not knowing why I'm going through this and what's really happening.I hope my story can help others cope with their IBS.

455,"I was recently diagnosed with IBS at the age of 19, through the theory of elimination. When it first began I was extremely ill and was going to sit in the bathroom to pass gas every hour. I went to the doctor and they gave me something to control the diarrhea, thinking I had some kind of bug.I got better for a few days and then it came back, my doctor ran all sorts of blood tests and because my liver enzyme levels were slightly elevated they thought I might have a virus.Then came hell, a battery of tests to figure out if perhaps I had hepatitis. Hep A and B tests came back negative right away but I had to endure two weeks of waiting for Hep C to come back negative. I was so weak and the blood tests made me even weaker afterward.I was so scared that something was horribly wrong with me. It still makes me upset to think about it. My dad was so worried because I don't live at home and my parents were too far away to come and comfort me. My phone bills were astronomical.Through all this I was trying to go to university and hold down a job as a lifeguard. I wasn't able to work and I missed a lot of classes. Luckily my boss and my profs were very understanding.Although I have not found total relief and I ask 'why me', I am glad that this syndrome does not usually lead to more life-threatening conditions further down the road. When I am on the toilet and I want do die because it just hurts so bad, I take solace that it will pass sooner or later, even though I am so scared sometimes.I have found that ginger tea helps with the nausea and I have a cup every morning because I was so sick of being drugged up on Gravol. Peppermint tea also helps soothe my stomach and Japanese tea is just darn comforting. My doctor gave me a medication called Dicetel, which I take when I start to feel those warnings signs. Pepto-Bismol can also help as a last minute aid.Also cutting out dairy has been a lifesaver, I find that one bite of that stuff will send me in and out of the bathroom for hours.

It is hard to conceal especially when you're in class and ask to use the washroom and then everybody realizes you are gone for like 15 minutes, it sucks.I hope people understand that you may give this syndrome to your kids. Although my mom has it very mild and got it in her later years, I have it very strong and have it now as a teen. It really is no way to live. I accept it and do not mope over it because I know there will be a cure, in the meantime there are always anti-diarrheals.E-mail Lizzy:[email protected]",,stratum,email,syndrome,class,stratum,stomach,doctor,doctor,teenager,female

458,"I'm 17 years old and have recently found out that I have irritable bowel syndrome. I have always had a dodgy tummy but it really became a problem when I was 10 or so. I used to get very intense pain in my stomach followed by diarrhea and vomiting, and on occasions I would pass out. I was later told that they were bowel spasms.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));The doctors didn't know what was wrong with me, firstly they told me I had endometriosis and that I was infertile, then they said it was all in my head, even my parents started to disbelieve me.At 14 I was in so much constant pain that I was unable to go to school, and when I was in school and had a spasm the teachers told me that I was faking it and that I had a mental problem (those were their exact words).At the age of 16 I was so tired of fighting the pain that I couldn't cope, sometimes I was having up to three spasms a day, passing out on the bathroom floor. My 16th birthday was especially bad, I had a spasm that lasted five hours and spent the whole day vomiting and sat on the loo!The pain was indescribable, and sometimes when it is really bad you pray to die. Eventually I was diagnosed with IBS and given medication. I still get occasional bouts of spasms and pain but thankfully it is better now, touch wood.I never went back to school, instead I am now at college. They know about my IBS and are very supportive if I have a spasm there or am unable to attend. I was told that I would probably suffer from irritable bowel syndrome for the rest of my life, but now it's better, I cope.It's very embarrassing when your out somewhere and have a spasm, especially when you pass out. When I do have a spasm though, I take codeine and spend the rest of the day on the loo. Doing breathing exercises helps, and the most important thing is a hot water bottle.The medication that helped the most was something I was very shocked to be prescribed, antidepressants! The doctors told me that it would help slow down the pain messages to my brain and therefore help the pain; in my eyes though I thought that they thought I was crazy and had a mental problem, or that is was all in my head.I was only put on a very low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline, 10mg three times a day, and to my amazement and relief, after a few months, they worked, and I swear by them know.I still get pain and spasms now and again but not as often as I used to. I can get on with my life know, and even though exercising makes the pain worse, and I get tired a lot, thanks to my family and friends, and the medication and hot water bottle of course, I can cope with the IBS,

459,"Hey. My name is Emma and I've had IBS for about a year and a half. I'm 17 years old now and trying my best to get better and try different 
medications. I've read many of your stories and I give you all so much credit for trying to fight through this disease. Whenever I complain about it, I will think 'Why am I complaining? There are other people out there with life-threatening diseases and I am complaining?' And that fact is true...IBS isn't life-threatening...but wow does it ever take over.I feel like my life is on hold. I'm currently working at a grocery store, but I hate the job. I really want to work at this certain restaurant in town but my mind says 'OK I'll apply there...but after I fix my stomach problems'. Everything I want to do revolves around my stomach! I live every day thinking 'OK I'll do that...once my stomach's better'.But will it get better? Will I be able to live a normal life? I swear, I envy any person who can sit through a class at school and eat a bag of chips and drink a milkshake. I wish for even a day I could be like that. And at this age you shouldn't be wishing to be normal...in fact at any age really! As I read some of your stories I read symptoms that are so much worse than mine...and I'm sorry. I can just imagine.I try every day to have hope to get better. I feel like I have tried everything! Different eating plans, medications, natural things, and I feel like I'd have to wait months and years to see any changes kick in. It takes enough motivation for me to do all my homework, attend school, work out at the gym and keep a steady job. Never mind adding IBS on top of all this! It makes everything twice as hard of a job.Anyways, I just wanted to give all my hope to all you out there with this problem...I feel for you all. And I would appreciate any e-mails from you if you need to get thoughts off your chest, have advice on treatments or have any words of motivation for me!

460,"I am a 15 year-old girl in high school, and I've been suffering from IBS ever since my father died when I was 13. It felt like a curse after all the pain I'd been going through trying to get over him. He died at the very start of summer vacation, and I got loads of visits from my relatives. Unfortunately, I spent half the time they were there in the can, wishing I were dead from all the pain.I remember when my aunt and uncle from the West took me to see Pirates of the Caribbean not long after the funeral was over, and I was really looking forward to the distraction. Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what was going on with my guts, so I wasn't prepared at all. I bought a bag of Twizzlers, and after eating one, my guts cramped up wildly, and I ran off to the bathroom.I had terribly painful diarrhea, and I got so frustrated, because even though I still felt like I needed to go, my guts refused to let anything else out. So then I returned to the theater, and only a few moments into the movie, I cramped up again! I had diarrhea two more times, and I was so much in pain, and so embarrassed that I just wanted to curl up in the toilet and die. I told my aunt and uncle that I was just sick, but I was really worried about what was wrong with me.Three months later when school started, I finally got scoped, tested, and turned inside out only to have them tell me that I had IBS, and that there was no cure. I was devastated. Plus, I have antibodies for celiac disease, and I'm praying with all my heart that I won't get that too.Currently, I'm still recovering from a bad recurrence that started during Christmas, and still hasn't stopped even though it's been happening for several months. I've lost so much weight, I'm only 102 pounds when I used to be 110. I hardly eat anything, and my mom's worried about my health.I really hope there'll be some more answers for why you and I have to suffer like this because I really don't know what to do anymore. To anyone else who's reading this, and is feeling just as alone and in pain as I am, I wish you luck, and a long, happy remission.",,pain,uncle,toilet,celiac disease,school,health,mother,pound,pound sterling,weight

467,"I have suffered from IBS all my life, but it was masked by the fact that I was diagnosed with lactose intolerance as a baby, and thus I always 
attributed the symptoms to that. However when I was 14 I took my SATs at high school and ended up not sitting them because I had nausea, crippling abdominal pain and other symptoms. It took me six weeks to get back to school full time!About a year later the symptoms were still persisting, despite a higher tolerance for dairy produce and the fact that I was controlling the amount I ate very carefully. My mom had been diagnosed with IBS previously and mentioned that my symptoms matched with hers, so I went to the doctor and was like my mom diagnosed with the IBS. From then on I was even more careful about what I ate in the way of dairy produce and I even managed to get through my year 10 exams, mock and proper GCSEs and AS-levels without much trouble.Despite this, in December of 2004 I was working in a local supermarket and caught a stomach bug from the cafeteria (the staff hygiene was 
appalling). Following this I fell really ill for about two weeks, but it also triggered my IBS and sent it into overload.That January I had A-levels to sit and I only just managed to do it; the teachers were very understanding. From then to now I have had non-stop IBS with it flaring up every week and sometimes daily. I lost over a stone in weight on the run-up to my June exams as I cut all dairy produce out and was not eating before exams for fear that I would need the toilet.I had blood tests and tried a number of remedies, with only Imodium having any impact, but even that doesn't work now. I had to have a provision to sit my exams in a separate room just to get through them, and I only managed that by the skin of my teeth. The result was that my grades dropped from predicted Cs to actual Ds.

In seventh grade I began to get stomach aches in the morning but they would go away. Whenever I would have tests or exams, my stomach would get active and upset. I would just sit there in the classroom embarrassed every time my stomach would move and make noises. But now I have more things to worry about.Anyway, in the summer before eighth grade I got what I thought was the stomach flu. I had frequent trips to the bathroom (not vomiting but the other thing). Then eighth grade began and I felt better, although every morning my stomach was extremely upset.Then before Christmas I had a test in PE and my stomach was at its worst. In January 2005 I began to take Metamucil, a fiber supplement. Things got worse and I would go to the bathroom two or three times every morning before going to school. Out of the whole eighth grade I probably missed about 20 days of school because of my stomach.Summer passed and ninth grade began. Beginning school was hard for me because it was when I was most nervous and my stomach reacts, even when I'm excited. In the morning I would go to the bathroom two or three times. By the end of the school I would have gone about seven or eight times. I stopped taking Metamucil. Surprisingly the frequent trips in the morning stopped (my mom thought it was the gluten in the Metamucil that made me sick). Then I switched to Citrucel and began taking Zoloft (an anxiety medication) because my parents thought that I had anxiety.Ninth grade began and I suffered. My bowel movements decreased to three or four times a day. Still I suffer from anxiety and the worries of school and my social life. Every morning I am so nervous and I can't stand the thought of going to school and having to go to the bathroom. I have A day B day, at school and on my PE day (A day) I have to go to the bathroom way more than B day. A day is my core day so it's worse. I have to go to the bathroom once before PE, and then once in between each class.Now I am seeing a GI doctor for children. They are not very helpful. They have given me blood tests, stool tests, and now they want to do a biopsy. I don't think so! It sounds so violating. I really don't want to do it. Oh yeah, I am also lactose intolerant, I think. No tests done yet but I am definitely sensitive to chocolate, milk, and cheese. What else could it be?Well, Christmas break is almost over and 2006 will soon begin.

470,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Unfortunately, IBS is something I know about first hand. I can't tell you technical details, but I can tell you my story. I was reading through some of the other stories and then I closed out the site. I didn't want to tell my story then, but maybe if I tell it now, maybe it can help somebody else.I'm a young female. I'm not 11 or 12, I'm not that young. Let me flashback. My whole IBS nightmare started when I was in kindergarten. I hated school, hated the teacher, so I was nervous about school, etc. I didn't have the best eating/drinking habits either. I was quite a fan of coca-cola. God, I use to guzzle those down like crazy back then.Well, then it happened. I kept getting sick at my stomach and every time I'd get sick at my stomach, I would have these awful-tasting burps. I know burps don't taste like chocolate, not at all. Whenever I got these burps, I dropped everything. I wouldn't go to school when I got the burps because I knew I would be barfing. And yes, I did barf. I barfed a lot.Went to the doctor, the doc told me I had IBS. He also said to drop the dark drinks, so I dropped the cokes, the Pepsi drinks, etc. The doc put me on two kinds of medicines. They were syrups. I can remember the name of one of the syrups, it was called Tagamet. I can't remember the name of the other syrup.I'd take the medicines, I'd still have trouble with the IBS. I was getting scared (I still am) of eating food. When I found something that would work for me, I stuck with it. For numerous years, almost every day, I would eat chicken breast and corn. Some days I'd have mac and cheese.I'd get yelled at from my father. He would tell me, 'If you ate more vegetables, you wouldn't get so sick so often.' Deep down, I knew vegetables didn't have one damn thing to do with IBS. I could've stuffed myself with five million kinds of vegetables and it wouldn't have done any good.And so I lived through it. I took it day by day. Some days I'd be fine. Other days I'd be sick as a dog. Then two other things happened. One made me pretty damn happy, but the happiness would later on turn to semi-disappointment.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I was in 10th grade and the IBS was slowing down on me. I wasn't throwing up as much as I used to. Will I finally be free of this? That's what I kept thinking and asking myself. I'll talk later on about the semi-disappointment.The second thing that happened, it was kind of expected. I barfed out on chicken breast. I'd have it different ways (boiled and baked) and I was just getting tired of it. I was too afraid to rock the boat. I didn't want to try experimenting with different food and then fall out of the boat. Oh yeah, I barfed out on corn, also.So I found something else that worked for me. Now my main meals consist of chicken tenders and carrots. Some days I'll have mac and cheese. I don't know what I'll do if I barf out on chicken tenders and carrots. Maybe I'll go back to corn and chicken breast. I can rotate in and out between the two.Just this year, it kind of started back up again. Thank God, I'm not getting those awful burps and barfing. Still, the IBS is back. I wasn't sure what was going on with me. Hell, at first I thought I had colon cancer or something.Let me talk about my new symptoms. To anybody that doesn't have IBS, I know what they'd think if I said something about this second kind of IBS. They would think, 'So what? Everybody poops. It's just a part of life.' Yes, I know it's a part of life.Let me go back to the symptoms. I would eat something (on some days) and I'd have to go to the bathroom and do the number two so many times in such a short amount of time. I literally feel like my stomach is going to explode if I don't get to the bathroom in time. It only happens some days. It's like my burps and barfing, some days I'll be fine and other times it'll happen. It's just a 50/50 kind of deal.My mom keeps telling me I'm going to have to go to the doctor. What's the point? Seems like you people have been around the block with this too. If I went to the doctor, the doctor will just prescribe some more pills (BTW, forgot to mention above, the same doc has put me on Pepcid AC and Zantac as I got older), maybe run some tests on me or something. But it wouldn't do any good.I take different stomach pills during some days. On heavy days, I'll take two of my Prilosec pills and two different pills my father has. He has stomach problems now, also. Light days, I can live w/o any pills or just one of my Prilosec pills.I guess until they come up with a surefire cure for this, I guess I'll go back to my old routine. I'll take it day by day and just live with it. I wish I could do something else, I want to be free of this stuff forever. Maybe one day, I can be free. Maybe we can all be free...I hope my story has helped somebody out there.",,pill,kind,kind,stomach,chicken,tale,doctor,doctor,corn,corn
471,"Well let me tell you a little about me. I am 18 years old, and I have always been wondering what this God-awful pain is that won't go away. I'll take you back to when I was in 4th grade. I was about 10 years old and I would always feel sick like puking.I would also have to go to the bathroom a lot so all day I wouldn't eat anything until I got home. It got so bad that I would go to the clinic every day and they thought it was in my mind and just sent me back to class. Than I started skipping in 4th grade, none of the adults could figure out why. I told them I always felt sick but nobody believed me.So it pretty much went on like that and the symptoms toned down a little. Until I was in high school. When I was in my freshmen year I was 16. But the urges of having to go to the bathroom were coming back again. I was so stressed from school and the fact I never got a chance to use the bathroom during the day I felt sicker.I would bring kaopectate with me and I would eat maybe a bag of chips at lunch. I couldn't trust any food. Than a little later that year my parents saw a repeat of 4th grade, I was going to the clinic every day and I was skipping. So they just let me withdraw.I never wanted to leave high school, I just wanted to stop feeling sick. So now I'm doing a home school. I have now been diagnosed with IBS but my doctor acted like it was nothing and put me on no meds.

472,"I am 16 years old and have had IBS with diarrhea since I was about eight years old, in first or second grade. It started out as simply some pretty bad pains in my lower stomach, but now I have the whole shebang, diarrhea, cramps, cold sweats and all. Luckily for me though, not as bad as many others.I sympathize greatly with those who must face the full wrath of this horrible illness, and wish that there was a shot or pill to rid one's self of it. It is just so embarrassing when IBS strikes, leaving its mark on the dozens of trashed underpants.I have found that some things that help are definitely lots of vegetables (or any fiber supplement) and also, I cannot drink juice when feeling 'on the edge', nor a single cup of coffee or a can of soda anymore. Going without them seems to greatly help me, and apparently others too. Also, sleep is a huge factor. I can do very well without any sleep hardly, except the fact that I will, positively, face IBS early the next morning.I also have lactose intolerance, but I'm not sure if it's actually lactose intolerance or just an aggravation of my IBS, because of the fact that even small amounts of milk or ice cream leave me having attacks for the next few days. Even with the full dose of the lactose enzyme pills, they do not seem to work. And oh how I miss McDonald's ice cream!So I recommend, beware of soda, coffee, fruit juice, dairy products and lack of sleep!

474,"Hi, my name is Rachel and I am 14 years old. I have suffered from IBS for as long as I can remember. It really started to become a problem when I was in the second grade. I had an attack almost every morning before school. It almost became part of my routine: wake up, brush my teeth, sit on the toilet for a while in pain. Now, when I am having an attack, I can't eat or drink anything because it just makes it worse. Because of this, I haven't eaten breakfast since the second grade. I seem to be very vulnerable to attacks in the morning.My parents didn't really think anything of it at first, but when the attacks didn't let up and just kept getting worse, they decided to take me to see a doctor. I'm not sure exactly how old I was when I was diagnosed. All I know is that I have tried many medications and am currently taking two different pills every day. Still, I will get severe attacks.I have missed many school days because of the pain. It bothers me so much that people just don't understand what I go through. My friends think it's not that big of a deal and even my teachers will make comments about me not being at school because they really don't know the severity of my pain. And yes, I have also heard it is just in my head or I'm just going to have to learn how to deal with the pain, but sometimes I just can't. Sometimes it is physically impossible for me to get off the toilet because that slight movement would worsen the pain.There have been times where I honestly have felt that the only way that the pain could possibly get worse is if my organs were to explode. The pain is that intense. I would never wish this disorder on anyone. There are times when I wish that my friends could experience it for just one day so that they would know what I have gone through pretty much my entire life.

morning my mother would feel my head and said that I am fine and I had to go to school. My family thought I used this excuse as a way of not going to school. In 11th grade my mother finally took me to see a gastro doctor. My mother told me if I am lying about being sick and I was just wasting her time that I would pay for it.When I saw the doctor he did some procedures like pushing on my stomach and finding where my stomach hurt and then he asked some questions. After the procedure and the questions he said it sounded like I had IBS, but I should have a colonoscopy. After getting a colonoscopy he said I had IBS. I finally had a reason why I was sick all the time. I felt relieved that I could prove that I was not lying about the sickness and I had a reason as to why I was missing school.I have taken medications but they do not seem to work. I have tried eating enough fiber a day but it just seems too difficult. Now that I am in 
12th grade I am the starting pitcher for my high school. Struggling with my IBS and not coming to school I was put on the ineligible list and no longer can finish the year off. I have been the starting pitcher for my high school team for four years now and my IBS has gotten in the way of me playing. I feel like I have let the team down. Not only that I do not think I will get a scholarship to college for pitching ability.This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me because of my IBS getting in the way of my goals. When my principal and sports director had to tell me I was longer able to play softball the sports director started to cry because she knew I had been fighting with this disorder and it was not her choice to not let me play. As I sat there crying I was very disappointed at myself, thinking 'Well maybe if I just forced myself I wouldn't have had to let anyone down'.My principal said to me that I was not letting anyone down and that sometimes I should worry about myself before others. He knew I had the IBS and said to me that there was just nothing I could do about it and not to be so hard on myself. I am sure that my softball career is ruined and I can only thank my IBS for it.

Now I am 15 I still face the same problems, but I am beginning to cope and accept it. I've lost count of how many times I have been to my local doctor's surgery. My mum would take me there, worrying about how much school I was missing, and each time they would give me a little bit of hope in 'curing' this illness. This only led to disappointment as the diarrhea and abdominal pains would still be going on.Numerous blood tests to see if I was celiac or anaemic; all coming back with nothing! I got extremely frustrated as nothing seemed to be going on. All the doctors thought I was faking to get out of school, but thankfully my mum didn't believe them - she has been very supportive over the past two years that I have had the problems. I went to the doctors again recently and I have been given an anti-depressant called amitriptyline. I am on a very low dose and I start taking them tonight so fingers crossed they help out a bit!My IBS was at its worst when I was first diagnosed with it. I was in my 9th year of school so fortunately I wasn't missing a really important year, but still I got lonely at home and missed seeing my friends. Through this time I became really depressed, some days I just cried and cried because I was too scared to go anywhere without desperately needing the toilet - the one thing I could always rely on to make me feel happier was music.A teacher at my school was very helpful, she sent work home for me to do regularly so I felt a bit more 'normal'. My friends were also very 
supportive and still are to this day. My GCSEs are soon and I have arranged to sit them separately to the rest of the students in my school, hopefully there won't be as much stress!Overall, I think IBS has ruined my life. It gets in the way of my social and school life and I hate having to cancel plans with my friends because I'm not feeling well enough to go out. I am very lucky to have two very supportive best friends who are always there when I need them and a set of friends who are lovely to me. My mum helps me out, her and my dad's diets have changed to try to suit my needs!The only thing is no-one seems to understand what I go through, they think I can just forget about it and try harder to stay at school or go out more, that I should just grow up and hold it in but then I can't!

480,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I'm a 19 year-old woman from the UK and I began suffering from IBS six months ago. Already it has given me depression and I haven't the slightest idea what to do about it. As you probably know, doctors don't really know or care about how to treat this condition, nor do they realize how seriously depressing and restricting it is to the sufferer.If I am sat at home, IBS will never bother me. The minute someone says we have to go out, whether it be just the shops or (please God, no) a long drive down the motorway where it is illegal to stop your car, the IBS is there straight away. The crippling stomach cramps, nausea, dizziness etc. It's so hard to explain but it is as if my mind is against me, taunting me, telling me 'You won't be able to go to the toilet if you need to' and that's it then, I'm a wreck. No-one around me seems to understand this though. People say to me 'If it's your mind that's telling you this, just ignore it or change it.' That is so much easier said than done, as you probably know.Now it's got so bad I don't want to leave the house, but try explaining that to your partner. I don't want to tell him that in case he gets bored of me not wanting to go out and then leave. He knows about my problem but doesn't understand it. He seems to think toilet habits are something you can control. Yeah right. 'Just tell yourself there's a toilet wherever you go, keep telling yourself that'. Obviously I have tried this technique but all that happens is my brain goes 'I know you're lying'. I probably sound like I'm crazy and sometimes I think I am!At the moment I can see no way forward and my social life is rapidly going down the pan. Work is a major problem. I work in a shop and I have a constant fear that my managers are going to put me on the till where I have to ring a bell and then wait a while for someone to relieve me before I can go to the toilet. And then I worry that I might have to go again a short time after and then they will make fun. I worry that eventually I might get sacked for having so much time off.All in all it's a very, very bad condition to have, something where you constantly look for a toilet everywhere you go and try not to move far away from it. Something where you feel there's no chance of you ever getting rid of it and leading a normal life, going out with friends, doing courses, studying, working, going on holiday etc. All those things seem impossible and laughable to me right now. I should also mention that my IBS is greatly increased when I get up early in the morning, anything really before 9 o'clock makes me feel sick and that sets me right off. Don't ask me why, I really don't know.How I haven't embarrassed myself at work yet is beyond me, but I pray to God I won't because I think actually doing it would destroy me entirely. I know the point that triggered all of this off. I was at a car boot sale six months ago, and I had to be there at 6:30am. It was a bit of a drive and also suffering from morning travel sickness didn't help.So after we got there it my partner said he was going to have a look around while I manned the stall. As I was feeling sick after the morning 
journey the thought crossed my mind 'What if I need to be sick, I can't leave the car or our things in case they get stolen. What will I do?' Then 
that's when the stomach cramps started and I realized I actually needed to go to the loo for diarrhea, not sickness. As you can imagine I quickly came out in sweats, shaking and looking round for my partner in the crowd, but I couldn't spot him.Eventually it got to that crucial point and I had to ask the couple next to me to watch the car and the stall while I 'went for a wee'. I then 
realized I had to walk what seemed like miles across the field to the two Portaloos which looked as if they had been there forever. And there was a queue about a mile long.I managed to make it though, and obviously completely exploded by the time I got there. The pain was phenomenal. To make matters worse the loos were absolutely disgusting; they were the kind you can't really flush, and I have no doubt they'd never been cleaned in the history of that car boot sale.So I got back to the car, very shaken up, and all I wanted to do was go to the comfort of my own home and bed. Just as I was about to ask my partner if we could go home, I realized that even if we wanted to, we couldn't. As anyone knows, at car boot sales your cars are stacked in a line on a field in rows, and there is absolutely no way of getting out until closing time when the other vehicles have dispersed a bit. Well, that was it then. I was up and down that half-mile walk to the toilet all morning, not knowing what was happening to me.Ever since, I've been afflicted with this constant fear of not being able to reach a toilet when I need to, and I can honestly say it's ruining my 
life in all aspects. I cannot get excited about anything, because it's all that plagues my mind. Obviously I have tried Imodium but after you've taken 
about five million of them they sort of stop working as well as they used to.The only solution I can think of at the moment is hypnotherapy, to try and tell my brain that this isn't a problem. I think that would help, but 
it's just so expensive I can't afford it. I don't know what to do, I really don't. And like I said, I don't want my partner leaving me because I don't 
go out anywhere.E-mail Claire:[email protected]",,car,toilet,partner,associate,home,sale,mile,nausea,social life,plug

Sometimes I'll miss classes for days because I feel too sick.Not only do I have diarrhea, but I get light-headed a lot, and I'm always tired. I've had bad anxiety disorder and panic attacks, and I even have insomnia and get heart palpitations. I was surprised to learn that these are all symptoms of IBS. I do go through different periods though, where my IBS quiets down, and it goes back and forth between constipation and diarrhea.I take Aciphex and Zegerid for my acid reflux disease, and I take OTC Axid all day long, almost every time I eat in order to counteract my IBS. People make fun of me because my diet consists mainly of carbs. I eat a lot of bland crackers and cereals, as well as bread, mac and cheese, and turkey.

It was so embarrassing especially as we were traveling and in a different country.It has traumatized me and ever since then I have suffered from IBS. I have also gained many other lovely disorders relating to my IBS and anxiety such as social phobia, OCD, depression, panic attacks and various others (all of which make my IBS worse). I went to cognitive therapy this winter and they managed to help with my depression and panic attacks but they couldn't help with the rest because I have an 'underlying fear' and 'I need to sort out my IBS first'.I also came very close to an eating disorder, I lost a stone in weight in just over a month as I used to eat very little in the fear of having an attack. I thought that if my body was empty there would be nothing to cause the diarrhea/constipation, but no it just made my cramps all the more unbearable and made me feel nauseous.I am always so embarrassed and very self-conscious about my condition. I am very shy now because of it and I have very low self-esteem. I am constantly missing school because of terrible cramps and diarrhea attacks.

I just put it down to me being tired or wanting a break from study.The second semester of college was even worse and my attendance was at its worst.

I was too embarrassed at the thought of having a diarrhea attack in a bathroom on college grounds. I'm generally a shy person so IBS is a total nightmare to me.I thought that I was celiac at first and cut wheat out of my diet. Although it did help for a while it didn't take longer than a week or two for the diarrhea attacks to become as bad as ever. My next assumption was lactose intolerance and again I tried a diet without any dairy in it. Unfortunately this attempt failed like the first one.I eventually gave in and visited my family doctor. I went to him with the assumption that I'd need a food allergy test but he straight away told me all my symptoms were pointing at IBS and that there was no cure for it except to get more regular exercise and to try keeping a food diary to monitor what foods triggered the BMs. He gave me Spasmonal Forte for the pain, which has not helped at all.Since then IBS has literally been ruling and to my dismay ruining my life. I'm afraid to commit to anything. When my friends ask me to go out with them I always hesitate and I've often turned down offers out of fear of getting an attack. None of my friends know about my illness because I'm too embarrassed to tell them, but I'm finding myself increasingly depressed as a result of IBS.In the last month my IBS has been a little more relaxed than usual. I've been able to control my need to use the toilet and avoid certain foods, especially ice cream which is a killer! I do however always carry Imodium in my bag just in case. I don't like to rely on it too much though as it makes my stomach worse in the long run.However today my symptoms have been totally different than before. I have never before in my life experienced constipation but I think from what I have been reading on this site that my symptoms are indeed that of constipation. The pains in my stomach are horrible and I've been bent over for the last few hours on and off in total agony and discomfort. I'm so fed up of having IBS, and I literally do not know what to do anymore. I'm finding it really hard to deal with it all. I've also noticed that my hair is beginning to fall out and I'm getting bad headaches. I've been to the doctor and he reckons it's all apart of IBS but I don't know if it is normal or not?This site has been a great comfort to me and I'm so glad I found it. It's good to know that others (especially my age) suffer from what I do and any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated!

487,"I've had IBS for a year and a half now. I'm almost 17. I get the worst kind of pains in my lower stomach, it feels more like someone is stabbing me in my intestine over and over. I've been to urgent care and doctors and now I'm seeing a stomach specialist. First he prescribed an anti-depressant, but when I took it I woke up in the middle of the night with a high fever. Now I'm on new medication, but it hasn't been helping me. I've probably taken over four different medications but nothing works for me.I get bad severe stomach, back and rectum pains, and weird unexplained bubbling embarrassing noises. I have a bowel movement two to five times a day. It's ridiculous. Now I'm having anal bleeding, and first I thought it was outer hemorrhoids, which I've had for years, but now it's practically dripping blood. It's either inner hemorrhoids that busted or something I have no clue about.It got so bad that I had to drop out of school, I was constantly made fun of and had constant pain in my stomach, and I couldn't pay attention to school.

488,"I have suffered from IBS, diarrhea-predominant, since the age of 16. I am now 19, but it already feels like an eternity. I cannot begin to describe the massive impact it has had on my day-to-day living. At times I wish I could stay curled up in bed, warm and asleep, where I feel safe, protected and (almost) pain-free.Pain usually comes on, literally, within seconds of me waking up and getting out of bed. In the shower, my guts start to rumble and churn, then for about two hours comes the constant running backwards and forwards to the toilet. On a good day I'll go two or three times before I leave the house; on bad days, like today (which prompted me to look and find this site for support and to know that I am not alone), I will go anywhere between seven and 15 times. I manage my symptoms with Imodium like most other sufferers, but sometimes when I'm really bad they aren't effective enough to stop me going quickly.When my symptoms first came on three years ago I became a very anxious, nervous person, and couldn't leave the house, as I would have severe panic attacks because of the fear of having to get onto a train (with no toilets) to get to college (45 minutes away). I have had counseling, medications, all the tests under the sun carried out - and yep, it's just IBS. And believe me I am not making light of the situation by saying 'just' IBS - in fact, it's an illness I wouldn't wish upon anyone, but sometimes I think it would be easier if I was diagnosed with some disease and maybe then it could be treated efficiently and managed properly; because I feel like I have no control over IBS. It controls me. It says when I go out, what I do, where I go.I have stopped being sad that this has happened to me; the feeling of sadness has been replaced with emptiness and the longing for 'normality'. I feel as though I have been stripped of my personality, I feel lonely, blank, isolated and jealous of people who don't even have to think twice about constantly worrying where the closest toilet is.Some days feel so hopeless, but I am refusing to let this horrible illness take over me, and neither should you all, if you are reading this.

I've lost friends, people have accused me of faking, I've had depression and been suicidal and I'm barely allowed to live my life normally. What hurts me the most is when someone tries to tell me it's all in my head, that it's a mental problem and I need to learn to overcome it by tricking my mind.

492,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_0']));I have had IBS for about a year now, but I was finally diagnosed with it a few months ago. All my life I've had terrible anxiety, but it seemed to be cured after 7th grade when I started taking medication. I took it for years until I finally decided I no longer needed it. I started having symptoms of IBS during my junior year of high school. I was having anxiety again, along with an upset stomach on most days. I'm not completely sure which problem started first, but they both caused me to miss a lot of school. Little did I know that it really wasn't so bad back then.After leaving high school and getting my GED in 2010 the stomach problems seemed to be worse. If I was going out somewhere I didn't eat all day. That was the only way for me not to have to go to the bathroom. It wasn't long until even that didn't help. I started having diarrhea a lot. The pain was annoying, and I slowly started losing my social life. It seems like it went from bad to terrible in a couple of days. The pain from having to go got so bad that my anxiety kept me inside.I told my doctors about it, and they thought it was just anxiety. I made an appointment to get anxiety medication, which somehow made the IBS so much worse. I used the bathroom several times a day. Sometimes I was on the toilet for what seemed to be hours. I went back to the doctors, and they told me to stop taking anxiety medication. I did, and my stomach seemed to go back to how it was...which wasn't too much better.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_4']));I am 18 now. I started dating my current boyfriend 10 months ago, and even at my age I know that I can't live without him. He is so understanding with my situation. If we go somewhere, I only have to give him a look, and we're on our way home, or to another place with a bathroom and less people. I've even asked him what the plan would be if we were in the car and I needed to go right now. He said he would pull over and hide me as much as possible so that I could go on the side of the road. Sometimes I'm scared that I won't even make it home. IBS controls me, especially when the pain is unbearable.One night I woke up out of a deep sleep because I was in so much pain and honestly thought I was dying. If you have IBS, you know how intense the cramps are. When I woke up, I ran to the bathroom and sat on the toilet and waited for the pain to go away. It didn't. Even after releasing everything I could, I was still in so much pain that I had to force myself up and wobble into my mom's room to wake her up and tell her to take me to the hospital. Then I ran back to the bathroom to try to get the pain to go away. It didn't, and my stomach seemed empty.I finally got in the car and went to the hospital. I had blood taken, and a few other tests...which all came back normal. The doctor said that I needed to get an 'upper and lower', meaning they put a camera in my...you know, and one down my throat. Weeks later I went back to the hospital for my follow-up and to talk about going to the GI for these procedures. The doctor told me that I wasn't going to get them done because the GI doctor said that it was IBS. That is when I was diagnosed and was given Bentyl for the cramps.In a way, I feel like I bring the pain on myself. I still drink soda, eat fast food and don't take the Bentyl. But I have honestly tried the healthy diets, no soda, and I have always been one to drink enough water that my pee stays clear. Nobody believes that IBS doesn't always happen because of what you ingest. If I go without food for two days I will still have to go once or twice. I haven't taken the Bentyl because I'm scared of having withdrawals like the warning label says. The only thing that helps my IBS is distraction. When I have to go, I get on the internet on my phone and try to read something interesting. When the pain is so bad that I can't even move, I just think of every other day that I have this problem and I remember that it will go away in a few minutes.Where I live about half of the girls my age already have a baby or two. Sometimes I would be the only one in the group who didn't have a kid, and I would listen to their labor stories and think that there is no way that the pain could be worse than what I've had to go through. I have even read a story where a woman said her IBS pains are worse than the births of both her kids.Only people with IBS can truly understand the pain that I go through. It's so extreme that it changes your life. I am so much more of a homebody than I used to be. I now live with my boyfriend, and even though he's happy that I don't party anymore, I still wish I wasn't so nervous to leave the house with some friends. My biggest wish for myself is that my IBS completely goes away, and I feel for anybody that has to deal with this problem.",,pain,toilet,anxiety,doctor,doctor,stomach,social life,fast food,medication,home
493,"It all started in the beginning of 2013. I was going to high school when I had a quick urge to go to the bathroom. I couldn't handle it so I had to go home. I then noticed I kept going to the bathroom constantly and I was getting a pain around my belly button. Then there would be days that I would be in school and I would feel like going to the bathroom every minute but I wouldn't be able to go constantly so I would go home early all the time. I then noticed it was getting worse to the point that I missed two weeks of school and I was feeling very depressed.I decided to finally go to the doctor they did many x-rays on my stomach, many tests, two ultrasounds and blood work but they found nothing and sent me home. Then I went again and did the same exact thing and they sent me to another hospital. So after going to the second hospital many times I tested positive for H pylori. I got treated for it and I tested negative after three months but my doctor told me I might have IBS because of all the symptoms I was showing. On that same day he discharged me because I had started feeling better so I never got tested for IBS.I am now 18 and I was 17 when that all happened. I haven't been going to the doctor for more than three months but I still have the urgency to run to the bathroom out of nowhere. I'm still on Miralax as the doctor told me to take it every other week for one time in the morning. I couldn't go to college because of my sudden urges to run to the bathroom which is almost all the time when I'm sitting. And I get pain like crazy!Since I can't go to college this also means I can't work. My parents don't understand what I'm going through and they want me to do something with my life but I just can't. I don't know what to do, I feel so alone because no-one knows exactly what I'm going through. I have no insurance so I can't go back to the doctors. I don't know how to apply for free medical since I'm not working and my parents don't want to pay for my stuff which I understand because medical expenses are very expensive.I sometimes wish I didn't live just so I can end my suffering because I'm basically worthless. I sometimes get the smell of food anI i want to throw up as well. I get constipation some days but most of the time it's running to the bathroom no matter where I am.

I used to go to the nurse and try to tell her how bad it hurt but she would tell me just to lay down. It finally got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore so I would go to the bathroom and lie about throwing up just so I could go home.My mother began to get worried and took me to my doctor and I explained to him the pain I was in and how it just kind of started out of nowhere. I didn't have to eat anything, it just started hurting really bad. The pain is indescribable really. He said I had heartburn, but after about a year and several doctor appointments my mom didn't think it was heartburn.We went to another doctor and he freaked my mom out by saying I was going to have a stroke. We were rushed to the hospital where they said I just had a common cold. At this point I was frustrated because there is no way for me to have a dang cold for almost two years. Nobody in my family has any history of IBS whatsoever, it's only me.So finally one day I was in ninth grade and my stomach was hurting to the point I felt I was literally dying! I called a nurse hotline and explained every single thing and she told me I was most likely bleeding on the inside. My mom rushed me to the hospital and they gave me some shot in the hip that stopped the pain in no time. I wish I could have that medicine all the time!My hospital doctor came in and said they didn't see any cancer or signs of anything in my blood sample so I most likely had IBS. I was frustrated and I told him that this has been going on for about three years. I was thinking that IBS was a virus that went away after a while like the flu. He then explained it to me and I realized that this is more than likely what I have. After that it all made sense.I found a GI doctor and he confirmed it.

Pain that felt like knives stabbing me in the abdomen. Going through constipation one part of the day to diarrhea the next.As it got worse my parents took me to the doctor. The first doctor we went to kind of brushed it aside, said it was only stress and that it would get better. Regardless she still did an endoscopy and discovered I had acid in my stomach and prescribed a high dosage of Prilosec. Before that I didn't really get heartburn but after taking the pills I started to get it frequently.We switched doctors about five times, each one offering a different cause with more pills to take but no solution.

499,"This site is an answered prayer. I'm writing about my son, Matthew, who will be turning 16 in a couple of months. Matthew has always had what we call 'poop problems'. Even as a baby he had a very sensitive digestive system. When he was in middle school I noticed that his trips to the restroom increased. He was running to the bathroom after almost every meal. Sometimes he would leave his half-eaten meal to make a dash for the toilet.We started monitoring everything he ate and how frequent these attacks were. We could not figure out what would trigger it nor find a pattern to the attacks as it seemed like everything triggered them and they happened randomly. He also had periods when nothing would happen. Sometimes this lasted several weeks, but right when we thought this thing had passed attacks would come on again. I never thought that it could be IBS. I thought IBS was an adult condition.So we dealt with it for almost two years until he became a high school freshmen in 2016 and that's when the animal turned into a beast. For the first few months of school he was having to get out of most of his classes to go the bathroom. All of his teachers very quickly became aware of Matt's 'poop problems'.I started to research the symptoms. All it took was one 'diarrhea constipation cramping urgency teen' google search to open my eyes. After reading article after article on IBS, and one trip to the pediatrician to confirm - my son suffers from IBS. We had a name to the beast! I expected a shotgun of meds from the doc to keep this thing at bay, but all we got was a prescription of diet and fiber. Boo! We've tried that already! He's already given up milk and pizza, his two favorite food groups.This morning Matthew missed first period for the second time this week. He's fed up, I'm fed up, so I prayed and then did one last search, this time with 'Imodium IBS'. I don't know why I didn't think of this before. I've taken Imodium for diarrhea before. So I made a mad dash to the store for Imodium multi-symptom, gave him two and put a couple more in his backpack with instructions on when to take if need be.I am very hopeful that this is going to be a life changer for Matthew as I've read all of the inspirational stories on how Imodium has improved the lives of all those people that suffer from the same condition my son does. I have tears of joy in my eyes to think that Matthew is going to finally get some relief.The upside has been that his 'poop problems' have not made Matthew an insecure teen. He is very social and has a great group of friends that know all about his poop. He has never been embarrassed by it nor has it stopped him from joining the basketball team and keeping his 4.0 GPA.

It's basically ruined my life and my doctor has yet to give me a medication.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0']));It's hard for me because my whole family doesn't understand what it's like to have the cramps and the whole thing, and the only person who kind of understands is my friend Brittany. Brittany and I have cramps about the same time because we eat the same thing at my house, and when we get cramps we either go outside and walk or talk to each other and help us get through everything.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'ibstales_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3']));It hurts to eat so I usually don't eat anything until dinner, and I sometimes don't eat that. If I eat anything during the day it's probably Tums or 
Rolaids. I hate how my family doesn't understand because I need privacy and they don't allow it, they just get mad if I ask if they could go out of the room because it helps calm me down.I remember this one time I was on the way back from a camp that I love, and the drive is about four to five hours long on a charter bus. We ate breakfast and so I had a piece of sausage, not knowing that my stomach would hurt. On the way back I was sick with cramps the whole way, and I was crying. The worst thing was that no-one understood, they just kind of looked at me like 'What's going on?'I never know what to eat because it may hurt my stomach. I wish I could eat what I want when I want but I guess I can't. I just hope that some day they find a cure because IBS is horrible.

endless nights with my family crying.

I have to constantly make excuses up to why I can't come out. When I heard it's a lifelong condition I wanted to run in front of a bus.

506,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));Where do I begin? I probably had IBS my whole life because as long as I can remember I have had a 'nervous stomach'. I am almost 20 years old but all of this flared up when I was about 17. And I just want to say thank God for finding this site because I felt so alone until I read some of the stories. Well here is my story...My severe attacks all started when I was about 17. That was the year of stomach viruses - I caught every one that was going around, it was a very bad winter for me. I was so sick all the time that my doctor came to the conclusion that that all of these flare-ups damaged my colon and he diagnosed me with IBS. He gave me a small pamphlet on IBS and said all you have to do is watch what you eat and you'll be fine...wow, OK that sounds easy...wrong!It is very difficult to know what's safe to eat what's not safe because sometimes you eat something and you're fine, then you eat it again and 
you're sick as a dog all night long with severe stomach cramps. It has taken me about two and half years to figure out what I can and can't eat and I still get sick all the time.My boyfriend, who is severely lactose intolerant, is very understanding but he has a lot of trouble sympathizing with me because he just tells me 'Well don't eat what you're not supposed to!' For someone who is lactose intolerant he knows that he can't have any dairy. What he doesn't get is that I don't know exactly what makes me sick.What makes my situation very difficult is that I am a very small built girl. I am almost 20 years old, I am five foot three and I barely weigh 100 pounds. I have been very small my whole life. What makes things worse is that when I first got sick with IBS I lost 15-20 pounds. I had people saying that I had eating disorders and no one believed me that I loved food but food didn't love me.The worst thing of all is that I am a baking and pastry student at Johnson and Wales University. I love food so much that I want to work with it for the rest of my life. I want to make people's weddings cakes!It's very difficult being surrounded by food all day, a lot of my chefs don't understand why I am sick all the time and it's not an excuse to them. It's so hard being in a class for six 1/2 hours with no breaks. I am constantly on my feet and almost constantly nauseous.Often when I get out of class I am dying to get to the dining hall to eat something, and as soon as I am done eating it's straight to the bathroom. I feel weak and run down and lost. And on top of having IBS I also have acid reflux disease which I am on medication for but doesn't completely help.My family, my friends and my boyfriend all try to help me in many ways but they don't understand what I go through. I often come home on weekends from the dorms to be home and a lot of people don't understand why...I should be partying and living up college life - ha ha ha that's funny.I go home on weekends because my mom sits up with in the middle of the night and holds my hand during my pain attacks and my nausea.

507,"Hello, my name is Amanda and I'm 18 years old. I have had IBS for about four years now...It has been awful, this is probably the worst thing any young teenager or adult can go through because hardly any doctors know much or anything about it and it cannot be cured.It was terrible what I went through before I found out. I was told I was just faking being sick from my teachers and my own parents and I was made fun of at school by kids. Finally, everyone believed me after I collapsed on a field trip in Washington.After that my doctor gave up and referred me to the children's hospital and I was put through horrible tests. Then the doctor said 'You have IBS.' I then tried several medicines and changed what I ate but nothing worked. Since then my IBS has just got worse.I miss school a lot...I'm always constipated, I'm depressed, I can't sleep, no part of my body functions right, my back constantly hurts. Now, I'm in my senior year of high school. I just had all my senior credits taken away for missing too much school! So now I cannot graduate this year and I feel like just giving up, the more stressed out I get the worse I feel.And just about two or three weeks ago I started taking a new medicine called Zelnorm. What is amazing is that it actually works! I do not have to go to the chiropractor anymore, my back feels great. I feel way better. I actually go to the bathroom more than once every two weeks.I was not even going to try it because I have taken many medications before and they either did nothing or made me feel worse.

I don't have a proper diagnosis just yet but I'm going to the doctor for testing soon. My parents noticed that my bowel habits weren't like most people's when I was a toddler. They also noticed that I had many, many stomach aches.I first went to the doctor at age four and several times after that from about ages four to eight. When I was six they finally thought that they knew what was wrong. They diagnosed me to be lactose intolerant and sent me on my way. Well, after a few months it was clear that I wasn't. My symptoms only became worse with the new medication.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-box-4','ezslot_1']));The poor doctor became frustrated and took me off the medication, then sent me to a specialist. I was about seven when I went to the specialist. They said that I was simply impacted and blamed my diet, and that because I was young, I probably just ignored the urges to go. The doctors simply dismissed me with a few enemas and insisted that it was all in my head. I don't believe it.I get severe stomach pains almost every day. I'm almost always bloated. When I was younger, I was always at the school nurse after lunch crying because of stomach pains, but no-one ever believed me so I gave up on their help. Almost my entire life I have been constipated, except occasionally when I'll get really bad diarrhea and cramping.I miss school a lot and it's so embarrassing when I do go because I'll suddenly need to run to the bathroom (although school rules don't let you go during class) or I'll suddenly double over in pain. People will tend to stare at me because my stomach makes strange, audible noises at random times and it tends to hurt too.The sudden, frequent urges for a toilet have caused me to become claustrophobic too for fear that if I don't have easy access to a bathroom that I'll get embarrassed. I get teased about this a lot, even by my own brother, and teachers yell at me a lot because I'm late for class because of an urge.Only my mom seems to get that I'm in constant pain and she's agreed to start taking me back to the doctors and tell them that all of my symptoms point to IBS, although my doctor doesn't believe in IBS.

now it is constant. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night crying because the pain is so bad...I'm doing badly in school because I'm too tired or in too much pain to focus. I've been to two GI doctors, and so far they haven't been able to find anything wrong. By default, because they saw some constipation on a CT scan, I have been diagnosed with IBS-C. I feel like no-one - especially not my doctor - listens to me or cares about how I really feel.The main advice I've been given is to cut down on stress, and I've been told several times that it's just all in my head. What a laugh. If any doctor tells you this, tell him or her to swallow some flesh-eating bacteria and see how stressed that makes them feel. Or just reach over and bite off their ear. Well, you probably shouldn't do that - but you can still imagine doing it!Every day is torture. My whole body is in constant pain.

514,"I'm 17 years old, and I've suffered from IBS since I was 12. I have sat through classes at school for years, enduring the most embarrassing feelings when my stomach would make these horrible noises (almost all of the time), and wincing to myself when the the feelings of a non-relieved bowel movement would make my stomach clench in pain. Teachers were not sympathetic - they laughed off bathroom excuses with raised eyebrows. I guess they thought I wanted to skip class, since I needed to go to the restroom so often.I was a laughing stock, because of my constant gas. I couldn't even sit in a quiet room without being filled with fear of someone knowing about my stomach problems. Pretty soon this fear turned into something else; I began having full-on panic attacks in the 10th grade, causing me to be unable to breath or even think properly. I was taken to both a psychologist and a psychiatrist, and both recommended putting me on different medications.Eventually they decided I was 'a threat to myself, because of serious depression' and I was sent to a medical center for suicidal and depressed teens. I only stayed there for a week, but it was the worst week of my life - IBS was truly taking over my world, and I felt like an imitation of a real human being. I felt worthless.I eventually was forced to leave the public high school I'd made so many memories in, and I had to start over at a Christian-based private Academy. It's my senior year there, and I am still having the same IBS issues that started my nightmare so long ago...my grandma scoffs at me, and tells me I have made her life very stressful. This hurts me beyond belief. She constantly tells me that if I just had a healthier eating routine, I would not have these issues...I wish she could understand how horrible having IBS is. I feel like I carry a huge secret, and most of my time is spent hiding it.I have been skipping meals recently in a last attempt to make my IBS less life-controlling. My grandma will not take me to a doctor anymore, because she feels we spent too much money last time.

I had just begun my first serious relationship and things were going pretty well. In February I got on birth control and for the first month I was fine. No symptoms really...a smooth transition for the most part. The next month I started to feel weird. I started to get abdominal pain, constipation, abdominal bloating, and after a while a broken spirit. That month I found out that I had hemorrhoids which was completely bizarre to me.After a trip to the ER for pain they told me I had acid reflux from stress and told me to take Prilosec and sent me on my way.

They said I had had an adverse reaction to the dye.I went back to the ER because I couldn't move...I was really dehydrated. After talking to the nurse she told me I could have IBS.

A friend of mine had suffered from it but it wasn't as bad or seemingly as bad as mine at the time.I went home in June for two weeks and headed back to school because I was working as a research assistant.

520,"I'm 19 years old and I have been dealing with IBS since I was 17. It started out with panic attacks that I was diagnosed with around the same time. I had my first panic attack and a huge storm in southern Ontario came barreling in and collapsed a huge party tent I was at, engulfing nearly 800 people underneath it. Shortly after that, I couldn't have a BM. I would get stomach aches from anything I ate, was robbed of all energy, and would go to bed at 7pm every day because I just couldn't deal with the pain anymore. I lost about 20 pounds, which is pretty bad considering I am only five foot two and 108lbs to start.I started going to the doctor about twice a week, and he thought it was all in my head of course. He had me on two anti-depressants for panic attacks and stress, which I later became addicted to (Lorazapam), as well as three acid reflux pills, and I was instructed to take multivitamins every day and stool softeners. At this point I was wondering how the heck I went from a normal teenager to this pillhead. I was so depressed I would never go out, I just sat in my room and watched TV, and this all started in the summer time. I couldn't do anything without being toast at around 10 o'clock.Come May of 2008 I started dating this new guy, and all the pain and BM problems went away for about two months. I was so happy, I thought it was over with. Then it came back. I have been suffering now for two years, coming up on three. I have the constipation part of IBS, and it is the worst. I have gone up to 14 days without a bowel movement, and the straining and pushing is driving me nuts. I sometimes get headaches from it, and incredibly bad nausea and abdominal pain, especially after I eat something.I can always tell if I'm going to have a good night out, if I've had a bowel movement earlier that day. If I haven't I'm doomed. My boyfriend thinks I'm selfish sometimes because I always want to leave our friends early and go home and just sleep, but he doesn't understand. It's too embarrassing to talk about. My parents are the ones who truly know what's going on, but they get annoyed too, as soon as I say 'Oh I don't feel good' it's like 'Ugh...again?!'

If anyone has any suggestions or just wants to talk about the problems they face themselves, please contact me. I'd be more than happy to talk to anyone.E-mail Karissa:[email protected]",,constipation,email,toilet,stratum,stratum,class,anxiety,home,school,friend
522,"eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'ibstales_com-banner-1','ezslot_5']));I am a 15 year-old girl who has recently been diagnosed with IBS. Well it all started this past July when I started to get severe stomach aches. Me and my parents just thought I was nervous about starting high school. The first day of school came and went and my stomach pain was just getting worse and worse. So my mom brought me to the doctor and he ran a few lab tests and then decided to put me on Nexium and Carafate and Bentyl, but nothing helped. He also gave me Zofran for the extreme nausea that I was having.Well by this time it was mid-September and I was just going downhill so my doctor referred me to a pediatric gastroenterologist. We went to see him and he did lab tests, blood work, stool tests and urine tests. He was looking for celiac disease and a few other things. Everything came back normal. Things seemed to be getting worse so he ordered a cat scan, a barium test, x-rays, and a few other tests. Again everything came back normal!One day after being in so much pain my mom brought me to the ER where I received four doses of IV morphine, IV fluids and  IV phenergan for the nausea and had a urine test and more blood work! Of course, everything came back normal. So I was sent home with Tylenol with codeine and Zofran! I ended up being allergic to the Tylenol with codeine and the ER told us that if I did not come back to the ER they would not give me another medicine. So I decided against that after being in the ER all night. That was not a fun night, I got there at 9pm and left at 4:30am!Well my gastroenterologist finally decided to do an endoscopy (tube down the throat and into the stomach) and a colonoscopy (up into my colon). As you probably know being 15 and getting a colonoscopy is very embarrassing! This was at the end of October. The procedures went pretty well and they found nothing but they did take a few biopsies which ended up coming back normal as well. They looked for other diseases and even cancer - luckily no cancer!After coming out of the procedure I was in so much pain I was screaming my head off! They gave me six doses of morphine but I was still in a lot of pain. After being in recovery for three hours I was sent back to my room. My doctor refused to give me more pain meds so the only thing he gave me was a shot in the hip. After still being in a lot of pain they decided that I needed to be admitted and monitored very closely throughout the night.After being discharged the next day I still was not feeling good. I went back to the doctor and he told me that I had had every test done imaginable! So he continued me on Miralax two times a day, peppermint oil pills three times a day, Fiber One three times a day, and probiotic straws three times a day. None of this helps, so I really don't take it much anymore.I went back and my doctor said to just keep doing the same thing (trust me this is not what I wanted to hear). From there he finally decided to refer me to a counselor to see once a week and told me to go to yoga to relieve some of my stress! (He thinks this is all caused by stress.) I love going to the counselor it really helps me a lot. I also thought I would hate yoga but I absolutely love it! It really helps relieve stress and I definitely would recommend it to everyone. I have also been put on an anti-anxiety medication which has not really started working yet but I have noticed a few different things.My doctor did tell me the last thing to do would be to swallow the pill camera or he could do surgery where he goes in with botox and widens the hole of my stomach and that way I can digest my food faster (one of the tests showed that I digest food slower than normal) but he said it would still go slowly through my gut so he doesn't know how much it would help. So we decided against the surgery but it will still always be an option.I am very sad to say that my gastroenterologist is being transferred and will no longer be at the medical center I am treated at. No doctor will be taking his place and there are no hospitals near here with a pediatric gastroenterologist so we will now be driving two and a half hours away from my home to meet my new gastroenterologist over this summer.Having IBS is very difficult and frustrating and it is very hard to cope with the pain. I have been told that I might grow out of it but they said I could have it for the rest of my life! The weird thing is I am a twin and my twin sister does not have IBS. Having IBS has caused me to miss a lot of school due to hospital stays, ER visits, doctor visits and tests being run. Some days I would even get up crying and begging my mom to let me stay home because I was in so much pain. I have missed over 115 classes this year!I'm at the doctor one or two times a week and sometimes even three. And trust me it's not fun having to make up work, because it stresses me out even more. I continue to have daily symptoms of IBS with mostly the extreme stomach pains and severe nausea. (I'm not allowed to take nausea meds because my doctor said it could be dangerous taking it every day at my age.) So the journey continues! Well I hope I helped you some. This site is very nice to have and to read about other people's symptoms. I hope we all will be cured from this terrible disease one day!Update on Gabby...Over the summer, around July, I was doing amazingly well. So much so that I stopped yoga for a while, stopped seeing my counselor for a while. Well, a lot of stress was caused at the beginning of the school year (August), I'm not going to say what happened (too personal) but it was extremely hard. This amount of stress lasted about five months! The amazing thing was my IBS was behaving itself! After the five months my stress was relieved (good news came). During these five months I was seeing my counselor.Well in January my IBS came back and in full force! It is very depressing, because I was doing so well and I thought I finally had it under control. Guess not. I am now back to dealing with the daily struggles with my IBS and it's really hard. Some days I cry, beg and plead with my mom to just let me stay home from school. I haven't been eating very much at all. I am too scared to eat, thinking it's going to make my pain even worse...I'm falling behind in school and that's not helping my stress level at all. It is hard missing so much when you're a sophomore in high school. Luckily, all my teachers know about my IBS and are very supportive and helpful.My daily symptoms are severe stomach pain (some days better than others) and extreme nausea. Being nauseous is something very hard to deal with. I have been taking oral Phenergan for the nausea when it gets too bad but for the most part I take dramamine for the nausea. I eat them like candy! I have been taking an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication for a year and two months. I do think it is helping some. My counselor does believe I am in a state of depression. She is going to have a meeting with my other doctor to see about upping my dosage.I have been in one of those weird moods...it's like I'm not happy or sad, I'm just existing! My family has been asking me what's wrong and I just tell them nothing because honestly I don't know what is wrong. But you know, the worst thing of all is going to the doctor and he or she telling you there's nothing they can do! I have been very emotional lately and cry for the stupidest things. I think I'm just frustrated with my stupid IBS. It's been very hard...I'm hoping to get my IBS back under control very soon. So my story continues...damn IBS!My daily medicine regime: twice a day - enteric-coated peppermint oil (does nothing). Once a day - Miralax (I hate doing this, it gets to be too much). Twice a day - probiotic straw (does nothing either). Once a day - Celexa (anti-depressant/anti-anxiety med). Yoga two times a week (if I'm feeling OK, recommend this to everyone!). Every two weeks - counseling sessions (definitely helpful).PS: For all the girl IBS sufferers, does your IBS get worse during your period? I know mine does! It almost feels like being pregnant and having contractions and the pain is 10 times worse! Not fun!E-mail Gabby:[email protected]",,pain,doctor,doctor,exam,nausea,stress,stomach,counselor,school,gastroenterologist
523,"I'm 19, and I was diagnosed with 'slight' IBS about three years ago. What made the doctor say 'slight', I have no idea, because what I've felt and been through is everything but slight. I've had stomach cramps and problems keeping me in the bathroom since I was 12 (when I can remember it at its worst). I used to have to get up in the middle of the night to have insanely bad cramps (consisting of chills and hot flashes) and rock back and forth until the diarrhea would just let itself all out. My mom had to hold my hand the pain was so bad.That continued on for years. I would be constipated and more or less OK, and then every two to three weeks I'd have the dreaded cramps. Those cramps alone made me worry, and I'd fear going out with friends anywhere or being stuck at a new house or somewhere where I didn't know where the bathroom was. I'd worry to death that I was going to get the cramps when I was out. This caused a lot of anxiety and fear about going any place, thus making me stay home. It was always a relief to be able to get out of something, a trip, vacation. I would feel at ease knowing I didn't have to worry about anyone else seeing or finding out about my problem.A year ago I found out I had a corn allergy, and had to eliminate the corn starch, syrup, flour etc out of my diet, which took everything considered junk food straight out. This really helped my cramping and diarrhea problem, and I had gone the whole time since then without having one of my spells. I had almost forgotten I had IBS except from gas, bloating and occasional mild nausea.Then last Sunday I 'caught' what I thought was the stomach virus my co-workers had had, until I got some strange symptoms. I was constipated three days before I got the 'virus', then I started having extreme nausea, acid reflux problems, intense hunger pangs, terrible mid-back pain and even worse constipation...which isn't right at all for a stomach virus. Usually diarrhea of the worst kind and vomiting happens, not constipation. I also needed to throw up extremely badly and it just would not happen.I went to a doctor who told me it must have just been a different form of the virus (and who didn't take time to find out my problem at all) but then I realized later in the week that it was either my IBS full-on or my IBS in reaction to the stomach flu. It's been a whole week and I'm still not able to go to the bathroom, and every symptom is getting worse. For the first time in a year I have the cramps again, and the cramps are a sign that I'll have diarrhea, but nothing's changing, I still cannot go.My IBS causes me to cancel on friends a lot for fear of it happening at their houses or out when we go to the movies. I also had a chance to go to Myrtle Beach SC and just passed up my first vacation in two years for fear of the drive. My parents don't trust me anymore and say I'm crying wolf. They think it's all in my head and that I'm creating it all, when in fact I do have something wrong. But I will admit the worry and stress make it a vicious cycle. They think I'm a hypochondriac, and don't understand how bad it hurts and how much of your life it ruins.I also had to pass up a job (my first job) two years ago because of the constant cramps. Just recently I got my first job at a beauty supply store, and it is already starting to ruin this job too. I don't know if I should hang on and keep it and just leave the customer and run to the bathroom when I work weekends alone, or give it up for now, and my parents are guilting me about keeping the job. It's not that I want to bum around, it's that my stomach takes over my life.I've only had one semi-boyfriend, but that never lasted. I will admit I dream of being presented with the guy I'm 'supposed' to be with all the time, and I hope sometimes that I can find a fellow sufferer (that might sound terrible, but I'd rather have that than someone without) just so I know I'd always have that understanding from someone. I worry that if I meet anyone else, they're not going to understand why I always try to get out of everything, and I'll be as embarrassed as ever to have this problem around them. I have a feeling that that part of my life will never happen and I'll never find anyone.I'm studying to be a cosmetologist and for the life of me can't figure out what I'll do when I work with clients and have an episode. I'm very afraid of the future, and all the stress and anxiety this causes. I've read a lot of similar cases on here, and you all have no idea how much you've saved me. This is the one place I can get away and feel loved among others, and feel like I'm supported no matter what. I'm terribly sorry for everyone who suffers from this awful syndrome, and I will keep everyone as a whole in my prayers, that we will all do what we can to help ourselves and live as positively as we can through it all.Please email me if you want to talk or seem to be having the same problem I am. I'm open to meeting new friends and sharing advice. Everyone take care and God bless.E-mail Kristen:[email protected]",,cramp,stomach,job,toilet,virus,friend,home,doctor,email,stress
524,"I read the book Sophie's Story: My 20-Year Battle with IBS, which was excellent, and I tried to get my daughter 'A' to read it but she gave up some time ago. She won't write either. We (mum and dad) can't give up of course. When I say give up I mean exactly that, she has no hope left. I remember, such a long time ago, when she started developing lots of GI symptoms and I trawled through various forums trying to get some kind of handle on this stuff. It was depressing but I would not have thought that 10 years on I would still be groping around looking for some kind of answer. Nothing has been resolved and what was once a bright and bubbly four year-old has been reduced to a shadow of a person devoid of hope and joy.In many ways it is a not uncommon story except that the signs were clear at a very early age. The problems emerged at school. Sometimes it was manageable and she was functional, sometimes she had bad episodes (these usually lasted six months) and missed a lot of school. She was referred to a specialist (for fecal incontinence and constipation) and also Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) within a few weeks of starting school for selective hearing and inattention. I suspect they wanted her on Ritalin. She was diagnosed with ADD and anxiety but not ADHD. We did manage to reduce her anxiety and help her cope using the usual dietary stuff, anti-spasmodics and relaxation techniques but it only took a relatively minor incident at school to trigger seriously debilitating IBS. It was always there, it stopped her playing and mixing and she really had a crap childhood.She was diagnosed with acute constipation for four years, then chronic constipation for six months until they diagnosed IBS. Unfortunately all this time we had been having problems with the education welfare people due to absences. They issued a summons for school attendance so the stress levels went through the roof. About this time, because she was getting worse, we told both the school and her specialist that we were considering legal action and as you can imagine all hell broke loose. It went to court, which is another long and complex story.One of the points we wish to raise here is that, especially with the new stricter rules on school attendance, a reasonably early diagnosis is essential. They are, I'm sure, very reluctant to provide this, but until it is obtained there will be problems with the school authorities. Our social worker pointed out that ""IBS is not life-threatening and should not prevent a girl from going to school"" and in most cases we would agree, although some degree of compassion and understanding is required. Our judgement was that it was at the extreme end of the clinical spectrum, a view endorsed by an independent medical witness.Our daughter suffered a lot. There is still a tendency to delay a formal diagnosis and try to get the kid to tough it out, learn to live with it, and early on we went along with this, but its' also a question of degree, of judgement, of compassion. She wasn't trying to dodge school and neither were we but the pain was such as to stop her in her tracks. We felt for her and we could not understand why the professionals didn't.We (the parents) didn't have a history of IBS. My wife thought that  most women, what with all the stuff they have to go through, would have an understanding of IBS and what it feels like and how it affects you, although with some of the 'professionals' this doesn't seem so. I don't have IBS but I do have diverticular disease which did take some time to control. I used to spend hours curled up in a fetal position, unable to think, just wanting it to go away and the world to end but knowing it would be back soon. When I saw A doing the same things I knew she wasn't kidding, she was the same and on the same meds.A word of explanation, diverticulitis  is basically caused by age and over-indulgence, so in a sense you deserve it, but it shouldn't happen to a young kid who has hardly done anything. There is something different about intestinal pain, the brain-gut axis certainly exists. It is sickeningly intense, it makes you confused, it takes over and you know that even when it goes away it will come back. You are afraid to go out in case you have an accident. I understood my predicament, why it happened, what was happening and the steps I had to take to control it, but a kid? They must ask, why me, what have I done?Pain management sometimes works and she had three periods of relative quiesence, probably something like three years out of 10. She fought it when she could, she tried, but then she gave up and withdrew. She says she has lost her childhood and it's true. We have lost her childhood as well. She hates watching children lead a normal, happy life because it reminds her of what she has lost.What about the 'professionals'? Good question. A couple of them were OK but it only takes a couple of bad experiences and now she refuses to interact with the doctors or psychologists. That's the thing about traumatic experiences, they are traumatic. This makes it almost impossible for anyone to help her. If there is no relationship with a doctor or therapist then there is no placebo effect. How important is this? The Rome group produced an excellent guide, primarily aimed at doctors, which evaluated a lot of treatments. On one of the more promising ones it produced a graph and it was to emphasis the value of the patient-doctor relationship. The general conclusion was that even with this particular substance it only had 20% effect and the major variable was the patient-doctor relationship that accounted for 60%. A good theuraputic relationship is probably the most important thing, having someone who believes you.As for strategies and treatment, lots of little things can work and they are worth trying. I certainly agree with magnesium, relaxation therapy, probiotics, fiber, exercise, yoga, but most of all, support, which is one thing A never had from the 'professionals' or her peer group (she never felt safe at school). It was the ability to form relationships and survive the 'rough and tumble' of school life that was beyond her.With respect to medication there is a glimmer of hope for people with IBS-C as one of the few things that seemed to have any real efficacy was Zelnorm. Even now people still talk about it and some even try to get it from India. There was a group of 5-HT4 agonists that seemed to have some benefit but there were problems and most of them were withdrawn. Whether they were actaully ever approved in the UK I don't know. However, second generation prokinetics are more selective and one, prucalopride, has been approved in Europe and the UK. Has anyone been prescribed this? I've seen the reviews of linaclotide and lubiprostone on IBS Tales and these are really useful. Any feedback from the UK? Regards, Peter and Sally.Update on A...This is an update on A and again it is from A's dad, A has still given up so it's still very sad. A met a new consultant and for once she really engaged, it was someone who at last listened and took a fresh look at things. The net result was a more thorough but worrying diagnosis. The IBS is now an FGID no somatoform disorder; ADD becomes ADHD; slow transit constipation, anxiety and chronic abdominal pain are items in their own right but there is an additional element of joint hypermobility syndrome with marfanoid habitus and that is because besides A's rather slender build she had other problems which the psychologists for some reason treated as secondary co-morbidities. They were weakness and fatigue, syncope (passing out or fainting) and visceral pain associated with other organs.E-mail Peter:[email protected]",,school,tale,pain,professional,attention deficit disorder,constipation,school attendance,diagnosis,kid,people

526,I am a 50 year old female with IBS with constipation most of the time. I don't feel comfortable having to have a bowel movement in public restrooms or at friends’ homes because of the noise from gas and the smell. I found bowel retraining program helped my chronic constipation problem - by having a set time every day to sit on the toilet to have a bowel movement then I don't need to have one in a public restroom or at a friend’s home. If I stay overnight at a friend’s home I get up early enough that I have my privacy and can take the time I need without feeling like I'm taking too much time in the bathroom or feel rushed in any way. I carry a pocket size air freshener in my purse and spray it into the air while I'm on the toilet. At home I strike two or three matches and let them burn a couple of seconds each to fill the air with sulfur smell from the matches. I have had constipation problems since early childhood and this is the only way I have gained control over it but It is a daily time commitment for it to work. – Name withheld by request,,toilet,home,constipation,friend,match,request,female,commitment,infancy,sulfur
527,"I am a 63 year old female who has had digestive problems and symptoms since childhood. Along with food sensitivities and frequent alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhea, I have had lots intestinal pain. In 1980 I was diagnosed with a severe prolapsed colon and had surgery to correct it. I had subsequent adhesions, endometriosis, multiple fibroids and ovarian cysts that resulted in a hysterectomy in 1995. I have done pretty well over the years adjusting my diet to help with the symptoms. I have tried medications and insoluble fiber but they did not seem to help. As I have gotten older the symptoms have gotten worse. I have eliminated more foods that seem to trigger episodes which has helped, but not entirely. Caffeine does not seem to bother me, but alcohol, even in very small quantities, will bring on bouts of IBS as do beans, legumes, fats, gluten, sugary foods, and some types of sugarless gums. I exercise regularly which helps a great deal not only to control stress but to get motility in my intestine during bouts of constipation. I think the symptom that bothers me the most is urgent diarrhea which can hamper one's daily activities. A positive outlook is also very important. IBS can really limit daily living, but the living is the important part and doing your best to know that this too will pass helps. – Name withheld by request",,food,constipation,diet,request,activity,kind,fat,bean,bean,haricot bean
528,"I would like to reach out with some encouragement for the many people who have shared their stories. I have been an IBS sufferer for 38 years. Through the support of my physician and my stress management doctor who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy I have wonderful resources that have helped me learn how to live with it and how to handle major flare ups. Yes, it can be a vicious cycle linked with stress, but help is available. What has been huge for me is that IBS is finally coming out of the closet and getting recognition for the valid medical disorder that it is. Until recently the shame of IBS was incredibly overwhelming for me. Now that its recognized by the general public that so many people have it, some of the stigma has been removed. I encourage everyone to be proactive with your physician and with finding psych support. Together they can be very effective. Give yourself a pat on the back for battling IBS and advocate for studies and increased treatment options. I'm working on accepting that I have IBS and deal with it to the best of my ability, and that everyone else will accept that too. Society doesn't condemn people struggling with diabetes, high blood pressure, etc. - this condition is no different and the social stigma is going away. Try to stay positive and surround yourself with positive people who understand your situation - and be ok with what your limitations are. Sometimes I just have to turn it all over to a higher power, when I'm feeling overwhelmed, and somehow its always worked out. We're stronger than we think. – Julia",,people,high blood pressure,stress,tale,doctor,doctor,resource,medical,disorder,treatment
529,"I am a 61 year old male and have had to deal with IBS-D for about 15 years. My first episode was at a football game and I didn't make it to the bathroom in time. Very embarrassing and traumatic. I thought ‘What just happened?’ Since then I have had other episodes while traveling that have either been disasters or close calls. Anxiety plays a big role in triggering episodes. I worry about having an accident which causes more anxiety which causes more accident potential– classic with the syndrome! I have learned to avoid certain foods and beverages but do occasionally fall off the wagon. Anti-diarrheals and anti-anxiety meds in small doses has helped. Mostly, I scope out the nearest bathrooms and let the chips fall where they may (sorry!! haha!). I love golf and always use the course restrooms whether I need them at the time or not just to be on the safe side. I am up front with my golfing buddies and they understand when I need to rush ahead to the next ‘hole’. Airplane travel is really tough when the light comes on to stay in your seat and you really, really need to go. More than once I have been ‘that guy’ who gets up and rushes down the aisle.

530,"At the beginning of this year, 2009, I was diagnosed with IBS. The problem had, looking back, been coming on for two years prior. What a bummer – no pun intended. I must daily consider: What, how much, the mix of, food and drink I put into my belly. Unfair, say I, a seventy-four year old male who has enjoyed any plate or drink placed before him. Recently I had to purchase a protector for the bed as I have had 'accidents' in the past and do a fair amount of traveling. There is a site out there that will tell you where to find public toilets on this Continent and others -- probably great if you are near one such. I have learned from speaking about IBS to friends and relatives (who I did not know suffered from IBS) that we all seem to be different as to just what sets of our IBS: What we ingest, the time period between onset and finish; the 'kind' of stool produced; mucous or no – a host of differences between us. I am slowly learning, I think, what I can eat and not eat (and drink) to best help in an understanding of ‘MY’ problem. I kept a diary for some months of everything that I ate or drank, the times, and the outcome. I changed my drinking and eating habits. I learned not to fill my stomach but take smaller bits and pieces over the course of a day. I chew my food well; drink lots of water. I have been prescribed anti-anxiety pills. I take a pill off and on if I think there is something coming up which might stress me. I find cooked white rice both filling and non-irritating to my gut. When I fail to look after myself (thinking I am back to ‘normal’) and the symptoms of IBS come charging back, I go to the freezer and begin to microwave rice that is always prepared. – Name withheld by request",,food,pill,rice,rice,beverage,eating habits,freezer,charging,prior,white
531,"I was diagnosed with IBS in 2004 when I was in graduate school. I was glad to finally have a diagnosis but when the doctor told me nothing could be done about it except be given drugs for pain I was completely stupefied. I was given several different drugs over a month, but couldn't function at all normally because of side effects. I was completely unsatisfied and frustrated. I don't want drugs for pain, I want a cure or something that will reduce the occurrence of symptoms. I have found out over time that stress and certain foods are triggers for me. I started seeing a nutritionist who gave me a lengthy symptom questionnaire to fill out before my first appointment. It had questions pertaining to every major system in the body. I was interested and hopeful. She altered my diet and suggested I take several supplements. The diet has been difficult to say the least, but I am determined to try to take as much control over my sickness as possible. It helps me physically and psychologically. I have learned how to cook through this whole experience and am grateful for that and for having reduced symptoms. I also started seeing a therapist who has helped me deal with stress of daily life better and has helped me reduce my anxiety. She has given me perspective of my anxiety and life. It is incredibly disheartening to know that I can't do everything I want to do, but I am thankful for what I am able to do. I've decided to continue on my diet, take my supplements, do yoga and meditation, and work on dealing with my stress. They are the best tools I have to try to feel better and have a “normal” life.

533,"I never knew so many people were affected by IBS. To think that all this time I thought I was a lone sufferer. Always feeling like I was alone and nobody understood me. Boy, was I wrong. I started noticing my symptoms when I was about 12. I thought that everybody experienced what I did. But as I got older, the symptoms got worse. I finally asked my doctor about it when I was 14. He rather quickly concluded that I have IBS. I thought he was just giving me an answer so I would get off his back. But as I come to research more about IBS, he was right on. I am the type of person that stresses about anything and everything... especially school. I keep my grades up towards the 4.0 area, and strive to do better. This determination makes my life a living hell because of IBS. Before an exam, or a paper/project is due, I get what I like to call an ""IBS attack"". Within these attacks I experience shaking, profuse sweating... to the point where I have to take off all my clothing, crying, cramping, and the rest of the works. During these episodes I wish that I wasn’t alive. I feel like experiencing one of these attacks isn’t worth living. Unfortunately, these attacks don’t come only before tests and papers are due. They occur before I go out with my friends for the night, before I go on vacation, or anything that is not just staying home. If I have big plans to go out and do something, IBS restrains me and forces me to stay home until I finish passing a bowel movement. IBS is my living hell. I hate it so much. I just don’t understand why something so horrible does not have a cure. I feel like nobody knows about it or cares about it and sees it as a simple complication that is manageable. Well, it’s simply not manageable. Something needs to be done to fix this horrible life that everyone on this website is enduring. – Jenny",,attack,attack,attack,attack,home,exam,website,people,plan,friend
534,"I have had IBS since I was an infant. My dad has IBS and so does my first cousin. I really think it’s hereditary. Well now I’m a junior in college and it’s difficult but I refuse to let it get in the way of my everyday life. I guess it does to a certain extent. When reading all these stories I realize my situation is usually not as bad as others, although at times it has been. It was way worse when I was younger. I didn't want to go to the bathroom because it hurt so much. As a result I always ignored the urge to go and before you know it two or three months had passed by. Yes, I would go two and three months without using the bathroom when I was younger. My system would be so backed up I had to spend a week in a children’s hospital. My mother didn't know what was wrong with me. I was depressed, it hurt to sit down, stand up and I didn’t want to eat. The hospital had to help regulate my system. After a week I was released and put on fiber, prune juice, and prunes but none of it helped. Today, I still don’t have a remedy but I just have to remind myself every week that I need to go to the bathroom even if I don't have a urge. I really never have an urge because I resisted it when I was younger so I don't get it at all. However, even when I use the bathroom frequently it still sometimes hurts really, really badly to the point where I'm almost in tears. When I get to this point I usually do a mineral oil that my doctor prescribed to take only if I know I need assistance. None of my friends know about this because it’s just too embarrassing to say. I wish there was cure but looks like I’m going to be dealing with this a long time. There is hope – mine has gotten so much better over the years. I just have to stay on top of it and don't let it progress or get out of control. – Name withheld by request",,toilet,system,plug,mineral oil,infant,father,junior,tale,child,mother
535,"I'm so glad I found this site. It's nice to see people, especially young people, who suffer from IBS. I was told I had IBS when I was 15, but my pediatrician thinks I have had it since I was 3–5. My mother agrees saying I constantly had constipation and complained of pain in my stomach. When I was in 3rd grade I was miserable. I was told that it was 'all in my head'. So, I lived for 7 years thinking I was crazy. I thought I was a hypochondriac. The summer before my junior year I got really sick. The whole month of September I lost 30 pounds because I couldn't eat. I was fainting and just so sickly. My parents were so scared, and finally my dad said he wasn't taking it anymore and was going to find the answer. I went to doctor after doctor, which between being sick and going to the doctor I missed 30 days of school. Luckily, because of doctor notes and my being able to keep straight A's, I passed. I had tests done and blood taken. Finally they sent to children's hospital where I was diagnosed with IBS. I am now a freshman in college. Every day I question if maybe I should go to the sister branch of my college, which would allow me to live at home until I was older and able to get an apartment on campus instead of dorm life. My first semester sucked. I constantly worried about how my condition would be that day. I missed so many classes because of pain and because of nausea keeping me up till my alarm went off. I went from a straight A student in HS to failing all my classes and being put on academic probation. I so badly want to be at home, just until I figure out what works for me, but I feel so embarrassed because my family (not immediate) will think I just couldn't do it. I already heard they think I won't finish just because I'm so shy. Social-wise college sucks too. I can't be a normal college student. While everybody is bonding over late night pizza, pop and even booze. I am sitting in my room fighting off nausea and gas. I feel so alone because I can't do those things and I never will be able to. My boyfriend is really great about my IBS but I fear one day he will just get tired of it. I understand why, but if he just understood what I go through. I hate that IBS runs my life as much as it does. I am on my winter break and I don't want to go back to college… at least not back to my dorm. I hate the fact that I hate college.

536,"I'm 22 and trying to finish up college. I was diagnosed with IBS a few months ago when I was finally fed up with it and went to the doctor. I was looking forward to a solution: a simple medication and it would go away... but it doesn't seem like that happens. My doctor prescribed an antispasmodic but it only seems to delay problems for a few days. Your stories have made me more wary as it's becoming more evident this really never ends. I can relate to many of your college stories. I used to enjoy going to the bar with friends. I've tried to continue going. I hold a beer in my hand or get a Coke and tell people it's Coke and Rum. It's quickly become unappealing staying out late and watching others get drunk. I try to at least make an appearance and be ‘social’ but it's hard when friends pressure you to take shots. I haven't figured out how to fake that one yet. My memory has been decreasing fast. It takes me a few minutes to recall a week ago, and 3 weeks... Forget it! Concentrating and memorizing course work is way more difficult than it should be. Does anyone else have these problems? I looked at symptoms lists and don’t find memory loss related to IBS. I’ve lost weight and look anorexic. We had a close family death over a year ago and I dread people thinking I now have an eating disorder as result. I wish IBS had another name, such as Constant Stomach Conditions. It's not an easy name to bring up and I've only told one person that's what I have. I'm pretty sure my boyfriend questions me when I say I'm not feeling well. His mom complains about her back a lot and overemphasizes that it prevents her from doing things, so it's easy to see how he relates my complaints to hers. I don't really tell him about it anymore. Everyday is just fine as far as he knows, because he doesn't get it.

537,"In response to Kristen's story from '07, I understand exactly how you feel. I was diagnosed with IBS a couple years ago and ever since it has made my life hell. Honestly, I'm not even convinced that it is IBS, but that's what the doctors say, so who am I to argue! I'm not the one with the medical degree... I have tried every OTC gas medication along with plenty of other things that were supposed to help like peppermint oil capsules, probiotics, heartburn medication (though I don't understand why my doctor gave me this), anti-spasm medications, and even anti-depressants! I have drastically changed my diet too and yet nothing has worked. I also have been tested for celiac disease multiple times always with negative results. My main symptom right now is severe bloating and gas, but because there is no prescription medicine for that, my doctors have told me there is nothing I can take except simethicone I wish they could help me prevent the bloating. I feel like there is something that can be done to alleviate some of my discomfort. To them it may seem like just a little bloating, but it is far worse than that. Even if I don't eat a lot of food, my stomach will puff up so much you would think I was pregnant. Unfortunately, that feeling and look can last up to 3 or 4 hours at a time. Talk about a buzzkill. That pretty much can ruin my plans for the entire day. I have come to the point where I don't even want to eat because I just don't want to deal with the discomfort and I don't want to live on simethicone for the rest of my life. I just wish that someone could fix this. I know I am not the only one that has to deal with this, and with the amount of people who are diagnosed with IBS, you would think that someone would be able to help us sufferers by now. I think that is the worst part of it all. Because there is no medicine or anything to fix this, we have no choice but to silently suffer through this every day. I just wish people understood what we are going through because it really sucks to feel like crap all the time when people think that it's all in your head or that it's not as bad as you claim. – Lauren",,doctor,doctor,medication,people,gas,medicine,drug,celiac disease,diet,head

539,"I had a fundoplication in December 2007 because I could not take proton pump inhibitors for GERD. A few months after the surgery, I had heartburn-like symptoms and epigastric pain that mirrored GERD, but it was due to dyspepsia according to the gastroenterologist. I finally felt better from January 2009–April 2009. I went to Arizona in April 2009 and got food poisoning from swordfish. I haven't been the same since. I had gas, bloating, constipation, and worm-like stools. I saw my primary physician when I returned from Arizona and she thought I had viral gastroenteritis. I also saw my gastroenterologist who prescribed polyethylene glycol for constipation and said ""at least you don't have Crohn's disease."" After months of suffering and frustration, I went to a different gastroenterologist who prescribed rifaximin as I thought I may have small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. It helped with the bloating and gas slightly, however, my stools were no longer worm-like, just foul-smelling. I took the prescribed dose of 550 mg 3 times per day for 10 days, however I had side effects from the medication including muscle spasms and tinnitus so I cannot take it again. It is disheartening that there is so little that can be done to remedy this illness. Even my gastroenterologist said that more money is spent on Erectile Dysfunction than IBS. My quality of life has declined and activities I enjoyed such as culinary tours are not an option. There are no IBS support groups in my area which makes matters worse. – Name withheld by request",,gastroenterologist,quality of life,gas,constipation,food poisoning,Crohn's disease,side effect,gastroenteritis,request,area

When I was a child I went to the doctor all the time with this issue and all he could come up with was 'Food allergies' I can't complain because they really didn't know much about stomach issues back then, and he really was trying to help. After years of nothing we gave up. After I got married, one day my husband walked into the bedroom and I was passed out on the floor. When I came to, he asked what had happened, I told him that my nausea sometimes gets so bad that I get light headed, sweaty, and dizzy. That was the end of giving up! We went to a gastroenterologist and he thought it was 'in my head,' so we never went back to him. We found another but he was so busy doing OTHER things in the exam room that I told him there was a monkey in my stomach to see what he would say - he just responded with an 'I see'! Needless to say, I walked out. Finally, I found a great doctor!! Not only has he found ALL my issues, but he make me feel comfortable talking about things females HATE to talk about.

I am only a 19 year old girl from Spain, and I started with this problems almost two years ago. At the beginning I started not feeling well with some kinds of food, so I begun to be more careful with what I ate. However, instead of improving, my stomach got worst; I had a diarrhea every few days. I ended up last summer with an appendix operation because all my family thought that that was the reason for my diarrhea. But when I began the university this year, everything was the same, or even worse, with even more frequent diarrhea. Now I have gotten to a point where I feel I don’t have enough energy to continue fighting. I have reduced the variety in my meals so much that I am fed up of always eating the same thing. Everybody I speak to says to me that it’s just the stress of exams that is the cause. In my opinion, maybe the stress has something to do with it, but obviously my digestive system has something wrong too, and I wish to find some medicine soon.

543,"I have suffered with undiagnosed gastrointestinal and bowel problems for 31 years. It impacted everything I did and greatly affected my years as a young adult. I finally decided that I would seriously try to uncover the problem because no one else seemed to be able to do that for me. I took margarine (not butter) totally out of my diet for about ten days. I also had myself on a very restrictive diet. As I added back food I noticed that as long as I stayed away from margarine, I had great improvement in my digestive tract. I would say that I feel 75% to 80% better. I don't use margarine at all now. I also avoid using corn oil and those of ""lesser"" quality. I do use butter, but I'm careful to not have too much. Because I don't use margarine and the ""lesser"" forms of oil at home, my system can handle the products I consume outside the home. I was truly amazed that eliminating margarine, corn oil, etc. from my diet would have this impact on me. I guess that I'm either allergic to those foods or I have an intolerance for them. Hope this helps someone. [Editor's Note: Fatty foods take longer to leave the stomach than other foods. Meals that are too large or high in fat may provoke symptoms of abdominal cramps and diarrhea, and IBS sufferers do often find that reducing fats in the diet may help with symptoms.

I went two years trying to treat myself with moderate success. I finally sought professional treatment after suffering daily symptoms while on deployment in Iraq. Apparently the increased stress I was experiencing was taking its toll on my intestines. I was put on a mild antidepressant and a stool softener. Both helped within a week. The only problems I still encounter happen when I lapse in my diet and eat too much dairy. I also found that I can’t take the antispasmodics with the antidepressant so I'm still searching for help with abdominal cramps.

545,"Thank you to everyone who has shared their stories! The parallels, such as doctors' responses, food triggers, social situations, etc., are amazing. I am a 39 year old female who was diagnosed with IBS when I was in college. However, I think I have had it most of my life. When Zelnorm® came out, I found relief through that. However, it was not perfect. I still got flare-ups, especially around menstruation. I did a little research on myself and discovered that when there is a change in my hormones during menstruation or around ovulation, my IBS acts up. About a year ago, I ended up in the emergency room due to severe pain. The only thing the doctor did was prescribe a painkiller. The interesting fact was that the painkiller could upset the stomach. Therefore, I chose not to take it. I let the pain subside naturally. After that incident, I told myself that I had enough. I would continue research on my own. I am not a doctor, but I understand that there is a relationship between the central nervous system, serotonin and hormones. I decided to try an alternative/complimentary method to relieve pressure on the nervous system. This and stomach/back exercises have helped greatly. I am not 100% and still have flare-ups periodically, but at least I can write that flare-ups are occasional now and the pain is more tolerable. I am no longer on the Zelnorm, since that was recalled, but I don't feel that I need it regularly anymore either. – Name withheld by request",,doctor,doctor,pain,painkiller,stomach,analgesic,menstruation,central nervous system,nervous system,acto
546,"I have had more than my fair share of bowel accidents, as I have frequent diarrhoea associated IBS. Basically it is often stress related as it happens to me as it is normally very difficult upon very short notice (seconds!) to come to grips with very sudden and urgent needs to defecate. Most of the time, I win. But there are other times that, well... I lose! Like the athletic community I have had more than my fair share of public humiliation and embarrassment in the extreme. (and I am only a 22yo male). With exception to two instances which were victim of prank, all the other instances are either unexplained or due to heavy stressful situations. As these were indeed sporadic, which actually makes it worse, there is no telling of an impending attack. It just... happens! So I have to be very careful and always know my surroundings: that is awareness of just where the loos are, whether they are indeed publically accessible, and that I can gain access within as quick a time as conceivably possible. Again, I am usually successful in this as I know my situation, but not always so lucky. It can be guesswork for me especially on travelling and in unknown destinations. Experiencing urgent diarrhoea attacks in public is no fun! Some of those who are 'uninitiated' seem to only make jest and crack insensitive jokes about it. Personally as I do take personal offence, I also understand that many of these people are rather ignorant and have not been properly educated thus living off of old and outdated mythos, as perpetuated through Western cultural traits. Also from a financial end, procuring rather hefty laundry bills from having to wash soiled laundry so frequently can become quite taxing in its own right. I have unfortunately wound up destroying some very expensive (and in some cases, irreplaceable) clothing. That is very frustrating as well, needless to state. But unfortunately there is no 'cure' for soiled laundry, unless one went the napkin (pad) route. Sorry, but despite my own plight, I am still too conscious in regard to wearing adult nappies! In a way, as this may seem rather odd, but I prefer to have some of these accidents in public as solely to EDUCATE the general public through hard and present experience, that yes, indeed this IS a more common issue than they seem to realise. In my case, I WANT people to know, and no, it is NOT a matter of 'pride' as one friend had begun to think! It is more of an altruistic sacrifice of sustaining embarrassments as bad as they are, so that the general public at large shall finally come to terms that indeed this is a very common problem.

549,"I am a 24 year old female who has been dealing with IBS for as long as I can remember. I was officially diagnosed in 2003 with the syndrome, and have been finding ways to deal with it more comfortably every day. The majority of my family and close friends know about my disease, which has made dealing with flare-ups more comfortable. My friends are extremely supportive, and being able to talk with them has made dealing with IBS more bearable. I now am able to use public restrooms more often, when previously I would hold it for HOURS, such as in high school, which was hell. Every day I left feeling extremely cramped and backed up from holding it for so long (sometimes to the point of having difficulty walking). During college, I started to space out my classes enough to allow myself to be able to go home to use my bathroom in privacy if need be. Now, if I know I can’t go home during work or when out, I usually will just say ‘screw it,’ and use the closest restroom. A friend taught me of the “courtesy flush”, where you flush during your movement so as to avoid any embarrassment (so many toilets automatically flush while on the toilet anyways!). Also, using the restroom at low traffic times, or using the farthest stall from the sinks makes trips to the restroom more comfortable. Holding it makes everything so much worse. Working can be extremely embarrassing, especially because after eating my stomach makes noise and I get very bloated, and usually will have a BM shortly after. I have found that by working at jobs where I am on my feet moving around, I am more comfortable and do not stress myself out on whether or not my stomach is going to act up that day or not, and if people will hear it. Having mobility also allows for my stomach to digest foods easier than sitting right after eating. I do sometimes have to make stops at home to relieve myself when certain situations are embarrassing, or when I know my BM is going to be diarrhea. It definitely sucks, but something I have unfortunately just accepted as being a part of my normal life. After doing research, I introduced probiotics into my daily routine, and stay away from as many fiber foods as possible. I noticed also that alcohol increases spasms, as well as greasy foods. If I am going to go out with friends, I usually will have a cocktail at home so as to get my bowel movement out of the way (and to allow any spasms that may occur a head start) in the comfort of my own home. Nobody else in my family has it except for my father, who seems to manage it relatively well as to not affect his life too much. I do get frustrated often by it, especially when I have 5-7 bowel movements on some days, but I would rather live as accepting of IBS as I possibly can than be uncomfortable throughout my days. I loved reading all of these stories, and have learned so much from all of them. Just know you don’t have to throw your life away because of digestive issues. It’s all about coping with it, and doing whatever possible to make yourself comfortable.

550,"I am a 47 year old female. The doctors are in the middle of diagnosing me – and they are leaning towards IBS-D (one doctor has ruled out the obvious culprits and is not ready to give a diagnosis, and another doctor in the practice who I saw on one occasion thinks its IBS). I have NEVER had any issues with my bathroom habits. The diarrhea started a year ago. At first it came on so suddenly, that I was lucky to make it to the bathroom! Sometimes I have the typical pain and bloating associated with diarrhea – but 90% of the time – I do not have any pain. I think that is why the doctors haven’t 100% indicated I have IBS. My problem is that when I have to go to the bathroom – and it can be any type of bowel movement – not just diarrhea, I have to RUN to the bathroom. It’s like my body is saying – ok – you have to poop – and you gotta go NOW – we ain’t waiting! My other problem is that I feel like I have to go – but that doesn’t mean I actually do go to the bathroom. Stress will make matters worse, but even if I take that component out of the equation – I think that only reflects 20% of the problem. I have to rush to the bathroom (for any kind of bowel movement) on average every other day, with the off days feeling like my stomach is very tight (gurgling, bloating, but no pain). From what I am reading, diet is a major factor and I am trying to cut back on the fat in my diet. Unfortunately, I am a very picky eater and have lived on dairy (cheese, milk, eggs) all my life! It is very hard to cut those out… This has impacted my life where I have isolated myself from having a social life. I still go out and enjoy my friends, but not as often I use to. And forget about thinking about dating! I am also going through my changes and have lived with terrible hot flashes that come and go 24/7 – for the last 3 years! I am almost wondering if going through my changes caused the IBS and if the IBS will go away when I get through menopause? This “thing” has blindsided me, and I just do not enjoy daily life anymore. Some of my friends and family members just do not understand it, and think it’s all in my head, or that I am thinking about it too much, so I am causing the problems to continue… I secretly hope they get a bout of IBS one day!

551,"Update to an earlier story: I am a 50 year old female who has had chronic constipation problems all my life. I remember my mother having to give me a suppository and enema but it would still be so painful to pass and still had to strain a lot. Back in early March of this year I was looking for ways to relieve my constipation naturally without using laxatives and suppositories on a regular basis. I found your article about retraining your bowels. I read it all the way through and followed the instructions carefully and then started myself on a bowel training program. It helps to keep a food diary and when and what time of day you usually have a bowel movement. Eating a big breakfast with a high fat and fiber content helps to kick in peristalsis very soon after eating. Drinking a hot beverage with caffeine helps too. Then 20-30 minutes after you eat go sit on the toilet for 30 minutes. Read, or listen to calming and relaxing music. Using slow deep breathing exercises help relax your whole body and actually helps you to have a bowel movement without having to strain or force stool out. I have found the deep breathing exercises to be the most beneficial to me . I also increased my dietary fiber to 25-35 grams a day and increased my water intake to 64 oz. a day. I take fiber twice a day, morning and evening. To make it taste better I squeeze fresh lemon juice in it. I use the very early morning before my roommate gets up for work to sit on the toilet for 30 minutes and then I can totally relax and not worry about using the bathroom too long. This also keeps me from having to use a public bathroom later in the day to have a bowel movement. I am totally uncomfortable and embarrassed because of the smell and noise it causes. I do carry a pocket sized air freshener in my purse to use in a public bathroom or at a friend’s home. At home I burn candles or use matches to clear the odor as much as possible. Ever since I started this bowel retraining program I don't have constipation problems unless I don't follow it daily. It has to be daily commitment on my part or I pay the consequences the next day. – Name withheld by request",,toilet,constipation,exercise,home,program,bag,gram,juice,partner,job

Our stories help us to cope and that gives me real hope. I am amazed when I see others who have the exact same issues and reactions as I. I would be so relieved if there was a pill I could take once a day that had all the nutrition I needed so I didn't have to eat.

I can just start the motion of eating and set off the process that leads to a couple of fierce cramps and then uncontrolled diarrhea. I have a classic set-up for IBS. First, I was a passenger in a motorcycle accident (a deer leapt in front of the bike my friend was driving at 50 mph) leading to seven surgeries on my gut that simultaneously caused and removed adhesions in and around my intestines. I had endometriosis which required a hysterectomy and ultimately, the need for a resected sigmoid colon to get rid of it all. So mechanically, there are significant issues. With my immune system overtaxed, I got Lyme Disease which caused gastroparesis or paralysis of the stomach. After treating the Lyme for a couple of years, the stomach issue resolved almost completely but I believe damage to the nerves was done. I am gluten intolerant and have multiple food allergies. All this has led to a malabsorption problem. Clearly the nerves and sensitivity of my entire gut have been heightened by all that's happened. Ongoing, my IBS symptoms occur about midday when I have one to two bouts (four on bad days) of urgent diarrhea and the rest of the day I'm okay except for nearly constant bloating. Sometimes I can go for a week with no problem. If I eat poorly I will have a heavy bloat and gas at night. I prefer only one meal a day and little healthy snacks, otherwise in the evenings I feel like I have a lead balloon in my stomach. I am just trying to create some coping strategies to make this more manageable. My husband is oblivious so it's not hard to keep the details from him and he is not supportive of medical issues anyway. I have not told my friends either (although I guess I could) so I feel fortunate that there is a place to tell my story among people like you who truly understand.

554,"I have had constipation issues since I was a child. I grew up eating southern cooking, and I did not like vegetables or fruits. I am sure that eating this way has contributed to the situation I find myself living with now. I also am sure that my abusive father could have caused me to have nervousness, which could have caused stomach disorder. I had issues for years; however, it started getting worse in my thirties. I was having more and more episodes with severe cramping followed by diarrhea and severe pain, and the episodes would last a few days. The doctor said I needed to take some laxatives, because I was having weight gain as well as the pain and it was because I was full of stool. I continued to have diarrhea and constipation episodes for years. I have had every type of test you could imagine, and the doctors never seem to think it was that big of a deal. I got the same advice over and over: eat more fiber, vegetables etc. I have tried everything, the doctors have suggested, but nothing ever works for long, if at all. I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome in my later thirties. I was happy to at least have a name for my nemesis. I started cutting out foods that I thought were causing problems, and at first it seemed the more I cut out the better I was doing, but I ended up just having never ending constipation. I am now forty eight years old and for the last ten years, I have had to give myself warm water enemas. If I do not use them every day I have pain and bloating. I also have started having problems with fissures and hemorrhoids, which is horrible when I am still having to enema. I have never discussed this with anyone other than close family members, or with women I was seriously dating. When I came across this web page and read some of the articles, I literally cried out loud and could not stop for a few minutes. I was crying because I felt like I was not alone, and others did understand. I have wondered what would happen to me down the road as I grew older, or if I would live a long life, or if this constipation could cause cancer or other issues. But I keep living, and most people who know me think I am completely normal. I never complain or talk about it, because no one understands, and if they did know they would think all I have to do is eat more fiber, or drink more water. I had a successful business in construction, until the economy took me out of the game. I never had a college education, so it was not easy to find a job, so I decided after filing for bankruptcy, I would need to return to school, and get some type of degree. I have been completing prerequisites for the nursing program at the community college in my home town. I decided to become a nurse, because I want to be able to help others. I do have times when I feel like giving up, because each time I have to give myself another enema, it is a constant reminder of my dilemma. I keep pushing forward, and hope to be a successful nurse in the new future. I will not give up, and I do hope that someone is able to find a way to help all of us who suffer have normal lives. I do appreciate all the people who have shared their personal stories, and know that maybe I am not as good at expressing myself as others, but I do hope that someone will benefit from reading my story, as I have benefited from reading your stories. – Name withheld by request",,constipation,tale,pain,doctor,doctor,people,vegetable,plant,nurse,kind
555,"Since I was 13 (I am now 20) I have had stomach issues. Beginning in the 6th grade I began to drop a lot of weight from not eating much because everything made me very nauseated. Everyone thought I had an eating disorder for the longest time, but the food really was making me so much worse! Finally, my mother took me to Children's Hospital Pittsburgh for an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy, to no surprise they were both clear! My issues continued but then seemed to stop. Now for the past 8 years they come and go. I remember from age 15-18 I felt wonderful and was able to eat anything I wanted! However, beginning in the early winter of 2009 my issues seemed to arise from a bout of anxiety. Anxiety was what I was told I had when there was no explanation for my stomach issues, which at the time made sense because I have an extreme fear of vomiting. So, I have been on an SSRI anywhere from the highest dose being 60mg down to 20mg. Now I am proud to say I have stopped the SSRI and realized that what is going on is not in my head! So anyways, since 2009 my stomach has been in and out of spells of nausea. (Nausea and unbearable bloating is/are usually my dominant symptom(s)). In the summer of 2010 I was diagnosed with GERD, which explained the ""pukey"" feeling I was always getting. Recently, I decided to make an appointment with Mayo Clinic. I had a hydrogen breath test (milk makes me pretty ill for a few days) which came back negative. A normal score is less then 20 and I only blew a 2! I then had an upper endoscopy with a biopsy testing for celiac disease which was clear. I have been to the ER 4 times since April 24th 2011! That is 4 times in one month due to the extreme bloating and nausea I have. Finally, the doctor diagnosed me with IBS. Whether it is more constipation or diarrhea, I couldn't say. It definitely began with more D then C but now it seemed to be switching to C! I have cut soda-pop out of my diet completely and try very hard to stay away from large amounts of fried foods. I also steer clear of milk but I find I can tolerate cheese and sometimes ice cream in smaller amounts. (Thank goodness because alfredo is my favorite!!) I began eating probiotic yogurt today in hopes of making myself a little more regular. My mother has also had ""stomach issues"" for as long as I can remember. Nice to know that I am not alone in this. I feel like such a baby when I complain about nausea/stomach pain/ bloating all of the time but I just can't help it! Hope everyone finds something that at the least relieves their symptoms to some degree.

556,"Hi, I am 59 years old and I have been fighting with IBS for 10 years now. I went through every test a doctor can give you, and with all their questions answered they told me I had IBS, there’s no cure. I have a very hard time keeping it under control. Whether I eat or I don’t eat, the symptoms just tear me apart. I can’t go out, I don’t have much of a life. My symptoms are diarrhea, constipation, terrible pain, bloating, stomach pain, hot flashes. They are very bad. I find my breath smells too and when I am having an attack I hate to talk to anyone. It definitely makes your life a living hell, sometimes I wish I did have a disease they could help me with. I go to doctors, and do as they ask, come home with prescriptions and pain medication. I find my pain meds help calm everything down so I ask for them. I hate being in pain.

557,"I am 50 yrs old and have suffered with IBS since I was a teen. Dating and traveling were almost impossible. I tried out for band and made it, only to have to give it up because I couldn't ride the bus to games because of the diarrhea that would hit without notice. I have been able to live with it, but I don't enjoy life to the fullest because of stress of not having a bathroom close. I almost cancelled my wedding and eloped because of the fear I would get to the alter and have to go to the bathroom. Thank goodness Imodium has worked miracles for me. I have a wonderful husband and two children, and up to this summer neither had IBS. But my 15 year old daughter started to have severe stomach pain which the doctors thought was just school anxiety from exams. After all summer, still having the pain and every test they could do, they found her gallbladder was only working 2% so they removed it in September. The pain from the gallbladder is gone but now she has a new pain after she eats and in the mornings. She had a colonoscopy this week and found no problem so they say it has to be IBS-C. This might have been brought on by the pain medication, which caused the constipation, which is so painful that she lays in the floor with pain and cramps. She has missed so much school that today we had to enroll her in a school online. She was unable to sit in class because of the pain, and the anxiety only caused the pain to get worse. I don't want her to suffer the same way I have for years. Surely they can find a cure of IBS. She does eventing with her horse and has missed a whole year of showing because of this pain. Right now they have her on a probiotic and an anticholinergic and a laxative once a day. The only thing I know to do is to treat the anxiety now, which really scares me with all the medications they might put her on. Prayer is the only thing that has got us through these past 6 months. I know that we aren't alone but it seems there is no answer either. – Kim",,pain,anxiety,school,Summer,medication,exam,toilet,stratum,online,anticholinergic
558,"I am 55 years old. I have been suffering with IBS for over 30 years. I wasn't diagnosed until after going to specialists for over 10 years. But... getting the diagnosis hasn't helped one bit. The medications that I have tried have not worked. Nothing that I have read about has helped. I have constant pain and discomfort. I have some kind of reaction from most foods that I eat. So, I have eliminated all but a few things from my diet. Some times even just the act of eating brings on an episode. This has impacted my life so totally that I don't want to do anything any more. I only do what I have to do - that's it. My husband has been so understanding. But he is the only one and even at times his patience wears thin. You can't have friends when you have this disorder. I have had to lie and make excuses so often when I have to back out of plans that I just don't make plans any more. It is so hard when you can't eat. It is so hard to feel sick every day. It is so hard when there is no hope of anything getting any better. – Linda",,plan,expert,diagnosis,brake,medication,constant,pain,food,diet,acto

560,"I'm 22 years old and am in the process of being diagnosed with IBS, I have a hospital appointment in a few weeks to out rule anything more serious but the doctor is sure I have IBS. I cant believe how IBS has affected my life! It started back in July and after one extremely embarrassing incident it never went away. It was my sisters christening in Yorkshire and my uncle drove my auntie, brother, boyfriend and myself there and back in one day. A culmination of the stress at seeing relatives I haven’t spoken to in a long time, a few boozy drinks, my dad’s wife’s polish spiced buffet and a cappuccino at a rest stop resulted in me having to get my uncle to stop on the hard shoulder so I could relieve myself behind a bush (we were only 4 miles from the next stop) we then had to stop at every roadside bar/restaurant through London, everyone was really understanding but it added hours to our journey and meant a lot of tears and apologies from me! Around the same time I left my job of three years and moved house and started my long summer break from university. My irregular bowel movements have continued and the urgency is completely overwhelming, this has meant I’ve spent a lot of time on my own at home and can’t commit to any plans/ nights out. Cab journeys onset a huge panic and I often find myself frantically searching for the nearest toilet whilst out with my boyfriend/ family. At a gig I went to recently I wasn’t comfortable using the toilet in the bar as there is only one and I knew people would be waiting outside while I used it so instead I had to leave the venue four times and power walk to the nearest train station where there was a large public facility. Traveling has become an issue, I panic when I'm on the bus or a long train journey, especially if there isn’t a toilet that I can use, the panic onsets the need to use the toilet and the memory of the hard shoulder incident makes it a lot worse. Before now I have been super active and had really full days without really having a break between school, work and socializing. This summer has been the worst! I haven’t really done much and have felt pretty uninteresting! I've had quite a few job interviews and have had to cancel a couple due to an IBS attack, I had to walk out of a hair appointment last week because the thought of being stuck in the salon mid cut caused me to panic and need the loo!

563,"I have been diagnosed with both IBS-D and Interstitial Cystitis with chronic pelvic floor dysfunction. If one isn't flaring up the other one is. Like others who have shared their story, I have a constant need for bathrooms. My 89 mile drive to work makes this difficult as do my somewhat irregular hours. Every day I have to plan my route around the placement of bathrooms along the way. I can go as many as 5 times in the course of an hour. I have been taking probiotics which seem somewhat effective, and an anti-diarrheal. I suffer from really bad flatulence which is especially bad after a day of sitting behind the computer. I have recently started body building again. There was a time that I was unable to do anything due to the pain and the lack of energy from medication I was on. The medication was supposed to help control the pain from the interstitial cystitis. I was so over medicated at one point that I was close to 187 lbs and on blood pressure medication. I decided to take control of that situation at the beginning of last year. I slowly weaned myself off the medications, lost 38 lbs and lowered my blood pressure. I know there's no cure for this horrible disease and I'm sure that people have no idea how embarrassing and uncomfortable, if not downright painful it can be. I have to miss quite a bit of work due to this. So far I haven't found a magic bullet. Stress remains constant at work and I have very little control over that. I’ve yet to find dietary modifications that help. I'm seriously considering disability but I know that's a long hard road. I have a combination of very painful diseases all in the lower part of my body. So far the only thing that gives any relief from the cramping and bloating is valium in small doses.

565,"I have had IBS for about 7 years. I have an increased urgency that generally lasts from when I wake for a few hours. Some mornings I go 3-5 times in a few hour period. The main problem is that I can go from feeling fine to having a large movement in a matter of 5 to 25 minutes. Needless to say this makes my mornings very restrictive. I feel that my symptoms are brought on in part by stress, and acutely by the stress of having to be near a bathroom throughout the morning. Diet has not had a very noticeable impact. I would like to try the antibiotic Rifaximin but the prescription was $800.00.

567,"I was in college when I was diagnosed with IBS. I had been having almost constant diarrhea. Finally when I was at the campus clinic for a cold, I asked about the bowel problems. The doctor told me I had IBS and I should eat more fiber. What a load of help that was...not. I spent the last five years finding my own triggers and crying and wallowing in pain and informing people who are around me. This is part of who I am and I think people should accept it. I am fortunate to have a family that suffers from bowel problems so everyone understood and my boyfriend turned into husband has been incredibly supportive. I have had my share of embarrassing moments. I remember taking a test in my psych class and having to ask to be excused to go to the bathroom. I had a great teacher who let me go and come back to finish the test. I had to run the entire length of the building to get the women's bathroom and barely made it in time. It was extremely embarrassing explaining it to the teacher afterward, but she was very understanding. Now I'm a kindergarten teacher. I can only go to the bathroom at certain times of the day. Still there are times I have to fight intense bowel pain to stand up and teach my students or sit and read a story. Another teacher across the hall has been my savior, because when I can't hold it in any longer I can pop in and say watch my kids please! Then I run down the hall to the adult bathroom. Equally embarrassing is the gas that comes with it. Fortunately, five year olds have great potty humor and it is good reminder that everyone has gas. Public bathrooms are nightmares when you have diarrhea. Is there anything more embarrassing than the nasty wet loud poop followed by the inane giggling or sniffing by the other bathroom occupants? I know I sometimes wish I could flush myself down the toilet instead of having to walk out of the stall. Remember you are not alone out there! Often you will find that people can be very caring even when they don't fully understand. Also, you never know when the person next to you in class or at work has the same problem and is just as afraid or ashamed to discuss it. I still struggle with IBS, but I have been slowly changing my diet and habits to meet my needs. Just because IBS screws with your GI tract does not mean it has to keep you from your life.

When I have to go at school I have to hold it until I get to a certain class because some of my teachers wouldn't let me go to the restroom.

Six months after dating he enlisted in the military, which I believe made my IBS worse. I read some of these stories of the people who have IBS with constipation, I would trade for that any day. In the beginning I thought I had colon cancer or something and after a year of having gassy diarrhea at least 10 times a day I went to the doctor. They did $1,000 worth of blood tests and checked my stool for parasites and found nothing. I cried in front of my doctor because finding out absolutely nothing was wrong made me feel even worse. I was leaving for a vacation in a week to the Caribbean and I wasn't even excited. I went through another year of dealing with IBS and finally went to a gastroenterologist. He checked my blood and stool again and found a parasite. I was so happy thinking he solved my problems. He gave me medicine and while on it I felt how I did 2 years before for the 3 days I was on it. Then the symptoms came back. He diagnosed me with IBS and nothing is working. I've changed my diet and everything. I've lost all hope and I completely gave up on myself. I don't want to work, finish college .All I want to do is stay home near the bathroom. This constant worrying completely changed me. I miss the old me who was excited to go out with my friends and party, and go on vacations, or even a bike ride.

571,"I am 18 years old, and have been dealing with the every day stresses of IBS since I was in fifth grade. I am socially withdrawn because I can't engage in normal teenage activities. My friends get disappointed when they invite me places and I don't go. They don't understand the anxiety it causes me to just go to a movie. I have lied about being busy to get out of going somewhere out of fear of getting sick. Going out is not worth the risk of embarrassing myself and ruining everyone else's good time. I am literally a “Party Pooper”. So, I sit at home, dealing with the extremely painful gas and cramps on my own, while other people my age go out and have fun. Worrying about getting sick stresses me out further, which ironically makes me even sicker. When something important comes up, the nerves set in and all I do is give myself cramps from the anxiety of maybe getting sick. I try not to get too upset when I am sick, but it's tough not to feel sorry for yourself when the pain sets in and you feel alone and miserable. I have even told myself it'd be better if I hadn't been born. But lately I've been doing all the research I can to help make myself better. I have simethicone (pills for gas). I use it for when I get my painful gas attacks. Antispasmodics didn't help me any. I recently bought a soluble fiber supplement to add to my diet. It's supposed to help both IBS-D and IBS-C...We'll see. I haven't been brave enough to add it to my diet yet because I know the first few days will make me gassy and uncomfortable. I think I will always have to deal with IBS. Some days I get depressed and wonder “How will I make it through college?” “How can I be a nurse?” and “How could I ever be a good mother in the future?” But the only thing that seems to help me through these thoughts is to take it one day at a time. I think that's all any IBS sufferer can really do. I try to tell myself that these are the cards I've been dealt, so I have to make the most of them. Somehow, I believe things will be okay. I just have to take one step at a time and take life as it comes. I am beginning to realize I can't control what happens to me, but I can control how I let it effect my spirit.

572,"My name is Liz and I am 17. Three years ago, I was formally diagnosed with IBS after years of symptoms. Unfortunately, as a preteen, the constant pain and irregularity led me to desperate attempts to control my stomach, including an eating disorder. Since my formal diagnosis I have become healthier and more optimistic that I will one day be able to regulate my bowels. I struggle every day in isolating trigger foods, mitigating stress, and living my life as a teenage girl. I have had many difficulties in overcoming the self-image issues that come with being a young woman with a quite un-glamorous syndrome. However, with the support of family, friends, and the help of humor, I am now fully comfortable with myself and no longer ashamed of admitting to my gastrointestinal issues. My teachers and close friends are aware of my circumstances and their compassion and understanding have alleviated many symptoms caused by the stress and anxiety of my frequent bathroom trips. I look forward to a healthy future as I explore new paths of treatment.

573,"I am 19 years old and lately I have felt so desperate and so frustrated by my own body. Ever since I can remember I have had to deal with what I now believe must be IBS. In a few days I have a doctor appointment and I intend to bring it up again, as the last time I had a severe problem I was told to eat more fiber and I don’t think it has helped. When I was little I was a picky eater and did not eat enough fruits or vegetables and from what I can remember barely drank any water either. I was almost constantly constipated as a result. I worry that I may have somehow damaged my body when I was young. I have also always been very sensitive to stress and used to be very shy. Within the last 2 to 3 years my confidence has grown considerably. Things that used to stress me to the point of nausea I now think nothing of. I have also cut out bad food from my diet and I now eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and grains and drink a lot of water. I began exercising and I am now fitter than I’ve ever been, and yet I still have this problem. I worry that maybe because I was used to feeling sick when I didn’t eat right and let stress take a hold of me that now I automatically expect to be sick when I am stressed or even when I’m just doing normal everyday activities. In that case I would have to break that mental association and hopefully be able to do things without worrying in the back of my mind. Now, instead of constipation its diarrhea. This entire month I have been miserable, trying and trying to justify my body's dysfunction. I think it may be from stress as my mom has been pushing me to get a job and get into college as soon as I can. I don't even feel comfortable leaving the house let alone having to go to class or work everyday. I can’t remember a time when I digested and passed my food ‘normally.’ I have been told many times that it is ‘in my head’ and that I just need to learn to deal with stress. I used to be so nervous going on a date that I get sick and I believe it interfered with my social life and my confidence. I am very lucky now to have a boyfriend who is understanding and supportive. Lately though I have just been crying and feeling so overwhelmed that I am stressing him out. Every time I get my period I have horrible diarrhea that forces me to spend hours on the toilet. I nearly dropped out of school in my junior year because every single morning I would have diarrhea and nausea and I just couldn’t sit through class. I graduated early and got a job, but I quit that after a few months and now I am trying to convince myself that I can deal with this. I’ve adopted a healthy lifestyle and I hope that in time it will help my body to heal any past damage. I want to be a biologist and see the wilderness and the rest of the world without worrying about walking out my own front door. Thank you to everyone who shared their stories. Reading some of them has brought tears to my eyes knowing I am not alone and that others have it much worse.

574,"My daughter will be 9 yrs. old in August and she was diagnosed with IBS about a year ago. I live in a small, rural community in Alabama. Our pediatrician sent us to Birmingham to see a gastrointestinal specialist. We were living a nightmare watching our daughter suffer from this disorder that I still know little about. She would wake up early in the morning sick to her stomach, slumped over with abdominal pain and vomiting on average 2 to 3 days a week! As a mother, I felt very helpless and began to wonder what brought this on all of a sudden. After seeing the specialist in Birmingham, we learned what food she could tolerate and what she couldn't. We have changed her eating habits... which in itself, was a hard task. That has seemed to help. I wish the school would be more understanding. Sometimes she has to go to the restroom suddenly, sometimes she’s fine and then cramps suddenly, and they don't seem to understand. Her symptoms have improved but are not completely better. The lunchroom manager at her school gets offended because I no longer let her eat school lunch. She seems to have less problems when I prepare her food at home. I want to be able to help my daughter but without hurting others in the process. I feel foolish as a parent because even though her symptoms are not as bad... I feel like I don't know enough about IBS, why she developed it, and will she ever get completely better. Our doctors here don't seem to know too much about it. There's always that what-if question. What if her symptoms persist or get worse like before? What do we do then?

I am so depressed and anxious about it that I cannot do anything without the fear of having an accident. So many milestones in my life have been ruined for me because of my problems. I have tried SO many different medications and nothing has helped. I take loperamide in advance with hopes that it will help when I have some event I cannot get out of. I work full-time in sales, so I have to be out and about dealing with people. The anxiety is the worse and that triggers the diarrhea. When I have to go, there is no holding it. So embarrassing. First thing I do when I have to go somewhere, is find where the restroom is and I don’t stray far from it. Such a horrible way to live, that it really is not living at all. I thought about giving up my job and trying to get on disability, that is how bad it gets. So sad and depressing. I have a very understanding husband and he is my support.

576,"I am a 27-year-old, with a belated diagnosis of IBS two years ago, alternating between diarrhea and constipation, graced by their friends--cramps and gas. The hardest part of this burden is feeling disappointed with my body. The constant canceling of plans so that I may stay close to a bathroom or being hindered by the sheer pain of cramping wears on me and those surrounded by me. Many days, I make grand plans to go swimming or to jiujitsu, or even just for brunch with friends but find that I am unable to go because of one embarrassing symptom or another. At varying points, the people around me begin to question whether or not the discomfort is real or exaggerated. I am being followed by a wonderful GI doctor and taking medication to help mollify the symptoms but with every failed attempt with this journey of trial-and-error , I get a little bit more discouraged. I've become obsessed with (and slightly fearful of) food. The idea of a 12-hour workday when I'm feeling subpar the night before is stressful. But, I'm not ready to give up yet; I don't have delusions about a magical cure but I look towards the day when I finally learn to manage my IBS.

I remember not even being able to laugh during a movie for fear that I would lose control. The pain was so intense and sharp at times that I would double over, screaming. By the time I entered college things had really gone downhill. I wanted to be like everyone else and be able to drink and eat what I wanted. I paid severely for it. I had ‘hidden’ bathrooms all over campus. The heartburn became unbearable at times, keeping me up all night. Eventually, my wild ways slowed and my symptoms lessened. There have been times of severe flare ups, when my life is extremely stressful. I am 27 years old and want to feel normal.

I am in real estate, so I can be at a bathroom or home in a flash. I couldn't go back to teaching because of the need to bolt at any given moment. Even with real estate, the number of ‘accidents’ on a bad day can be very depressing. I often have to do a hand wash and then a dark wash. It's a dark wash because I can only wear dark underwear. It isn't just the clothing and the accidents. Being single, I doubt I can have a normal love life because of the burden this puts on beginning a relationship. It becomes too much baggage from the very beginning. I don't know if it has to be that bleak, but my world is becoming more and more restricted because of this. It is a strange detour from what you would ordinarily think of as a life changing problem.

She diagnosed Spastic Colon (Yes that is what IBS was called in1975!) She gave me colofac (an antispasmodic, which shows how old a medicine it is). Since then on and off I have suffered with IBS-D. Throughout my life stressful periods have caused the most horrible flare ups with plenty of accidents but I have come to terms with that. I think my biggest fear is what is this, really. I have had blood tests examinations etc., seen gastroenterologists, but nothing appears to be wrong with me. However in September I had the worst gut infection ever on holiday and I have had the worst flare up ever. I suppose my biggest problem is fear because I also have panic attacks. Fear of what is going to happen fear of the IBS. My husband also has IBS but he just gets on with it saying he just has a bubbly tummy, dashes to the loo, and gets on with life.

583,"I have been suffering from IBS-diarrhea for a little over seven years now. When I was in high school I always had a sensitive stomach, but figured it was nothing and that I just needed to be more selective about what I was eating. That was until I started college and the 'episodes' would occur at least 4 days a week, several times a day. I would be embarrassed to go to classes because halfway through a lecture, I would need to get up and make a run for the restroom. And, even after going I would still feel like the same episode could happen only minutes later. Since then any time I experience any amount of stress or even any emotion beyond complacency, my stomach reacts and I am sent flailing to a restroom. It's horrible. My most recent relationship ended because my boyfriend couldn't handle the nervousness and anxiety I would feel about eating or being in public places without a restroom. And then because I was anxious and stressed, my stomach would react and I would have diarrhea, the one thing I feared happening. These symptoms are debilitating to my social and professional life. I don't feel I can travel anywhere without knowing for certain I will have access to a bathroom. My relationships suffer because I don't feel attractive or desirable when I am gaseous and experiencing frequent bowel movements. And I can't take a work position that doesn't allow me to get up and disappear for several minutes at a time incase I begin to feel sick. I have felt alone and frankly, abnormal for a long time now.

I have spasms everyday and always feel like I'm going to the bathroom on myself. If I didn't need my job I would quit.

It makes it very hard for me to do anything other than camp out in the bathroom and cry. I've had numerous tests, but everything comes back normal.

It's really gross to drink, and when I stop taking it, that is when my attacks reoccur with a vengeance. For me, it is well worth the awful taste in order to not deal with a severe attack. Diet helps me too, but who wants to eat cardboard for the rest of their lives? I find that with the psyllium fiber, I can pretty much eat what I want, except for foods that I KNOW will still trigger an attack.

I have medication that I take that is the equivalent of the GI cocktails I used to get in the ER's. I don't take it all the time, just when the IBS starts. I get really gassy, bloated, and have a lot of pain. Sometimes it is so bad I don't make it to the bathroom. I do have to watch what plans I make, and I always check in advance (even when I go shopping) where the bathrooms are. I have a change of clothes with me if I am not near a bathroom.

Anxiety may be general or specific to symptoms. ""Symptom-Specific Anxiety"" can be provoked by chronic, unpredictable GI symptoms like those that occur with IBS. It’s characterized not only by increased attention and worry about GI sensations, but also by avoidance of situations that may be associated with symptoms and the strong desire to limit activities to safe places. However, these actions, rather than limiting anxiety as hoped for, tend to increase and prolong anxiety overall. Various treatments may include cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, relaxation techniques, and medications or a combination of approaches.

590,"I started having gas and indigestion problems soon after high school graduation (1959). I remember being at a formal dance and I had awful gas cramps. I was wearing a tight fitting formal dress and all I wanted to do was go home and get out of that dress. I've had intestinal problems off and on all my life. For many years I had heartburn which increased as I got older. I now take a PPI, which has solved that problem. However, I suffer from violent gas cramps, bloating and intestinal pain at some level nearly every day of my life. Sometimes it's really bad, for instance, it will start up just as I'm going to bed and I'll be unable to sleep all night. I tend toward the constipation end of IBS, although I don't every get seriously tied up. I had a colonoscopy about two years ago which came out normal. So I was told I have IBS. I was sent off with nothing more. What's really frustrating is that I cannot see any pattern. I can't connect a violent gas attack with any particular food. When I have a bowel movement, I feel temporary relief. That means for about 5 minutes. My bowels can be fine, but I'll still have this awful gas and pain problem. I can't burp it up and I cannot expel it. I try to go about my business as normal, but sometimes I have to lie down with a hot pack on my stomach. I've been invited to visit relatives in other states, but I don't go because I think, what if I have a big gas and pain episode, the kind that goes on for days and days. I'm embarrassed to tell people I have such a physical issue, so I make up excuses. I live alone. I retired last year and I'm basically healthy. I exercise a lot; I swim, power walk, ride a bike and do dance aerobics. I get some relief from exercising and I'm slender. I do a lot of drawing and painting but sometimes I can't get into artwork, because I'm so uncomfortable. This really bothers me because my dream about retirement was to get back into painting full time. I don't know where to get help. I've read about all the foods that cause gas and it seems like everything does. I can't live on fats and proteins. It seems like doctors don't much care. They get their fee for the colonoscopy, but offer nothing else. You go off with no solution. I'm a pretty upbeat person, look on the positive side of things most of the time. But there are times when I lay in bed and cry because it's 3:30 a.m., I'm so tired, yet I cannot sleep because I have cramps. No one knows this, I've never even told my internist. I wish I could find a doctor or other professional who could help me figure out a diet that might help. I normally eat a low-fat diet with emphasis on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. If I tried to eliminate foods that produce gas, I'd starve. I'm 66 years old. Medical science has conquered Polio, Pneumonia, T.B.; great strides have been made with AIDS; successful organ transplants are commonplace; cataract surgery is a breeze... and so forth. But I have been suffering with this chronic problem since 1960, that's about 48 years, and here I still am, my enjoyment of life blunted. One more thing: I had chemo for breast cancer in 2005. While I didn't become actively ill from it, my stomach was in an uproar. I felt like I had gas in my face! It seems that ever since then, the episodes of cramps and bloating have been more frequent.

When this disease flames up, it controls my life. I start out feeling shaky, a little irritable, and then the stomach spasms start. They are so painful, I am afraid to leave the house. I cannot sleep at night, have twitches, am sensitive to sounds, sweat profusely, and feel like I'm going down a black hole. I can't swallow. My arms feel numb, and my torso very tight. I've tried to do all the conservative things they tell you to do... proper diet, less stress, exercise, but nothing works. I hate going to the doctor, so try to live with the flares, and tell myself, this too shall end. Usually, with me, a flare up lasts about 8 days. I never know when it’s going to happen. Not consciously anyway. One day its diarrhea 10 to 15 times, the next day is constipation so bad, you feel like you are going to explode. The shakes, the lack of sleep, the feeling that you are going to die, all are miserable. I've always been a person that kept things to myself. This disease is truly a living hell. The sad thing is, that when the symptoms subside, it takes me a week to recover. I always know that it will be back. Finally, this morning, I went to the doctor. I have been sick, really sick, for a week. He prescribed for me an anti-spasmodic medication. I'm going to pick it up. I hope it helps. This is the worst thing I have ever gone through. It causes you to lack self-confidence, be insecure, and, basically hate yourself. I don't want to leave the house. My husband tries to be understanding, but I can tell it annoys him. What helps the most is to be very quiet, keep on the same routine, not go outside, and tell yourself you will not die. It will go away. I'm just afraid this might kill me someday, even though I have read it won't. I just can't imagine myself handling this in my 80's if I'm lucky enough to make it.

595,"I have always been very emotionally sensitive to sounds, stress, challenges. I became chronically constipated as a young child in the 1950s. My mother gave me a stimulant laxative. By the time I became a teenager, I couldn't have a bowel movement unless I took a laxative. So for the last 50 years I took stimulant laxatives. I had seen many gastroenterologists who all recommended that I get off laxatives. I tried, but couldn't have bowel movements without them. I started having constant pain in the pelvic area in my mid-fifties. None of the doctors knew what was causing it. Finally, after reading a lot and going online I found out my pelvic floor muscles were going into a spasm, thereby causing the pain. This was happening because of the forceful action of the laxatives. I stopped taking the laxatives and used enemas. Now, I use an osmotic laxative. It helps me. I have very slow motility. It takes 4 to 5 days for the fecal matter to move through my intestines...even with the osmotic laxative and I have lots of gas. I have gotten the most help from alternative therapists that work with the whole person rather than just one part of the body. I also found that taking care of my stress level helps a lot. Find a ""Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction"" program in your city. They can help you learn how to calm yourself down when you are upset, through meditation.

596,"First off it's comforting to know I'm not alone. I started having GI troubles when I was 17, a senior in high school. I found out 7 months later, after increasing pain daily, developing anxiety and dropping out of school, that I had a non functioning gallbladder. Had it removed but it I didn't get much better. It took away the severe pain and I could eat again but I still had abnormal bowel habits and got a new abdominal pain. I saw a couple GI doctors in town going through a myriad of tests; x rays, CTs, endoscopies and colonoscopies, small bowel series, blood tests, etc. All that ever came of it was one of them noticed slight irritation during the colonoscopy, but nothing to warrant any diagnosis. Finally one of them felt he didn't know enough to help me so I was referred to a Gastro at a teaching hospital out of town. Been seeing him for two years, doing repeat procedures, trying medications with little to no result. It was getting really frustrating having to drive 3 hours both ways for a 15 minute appointment. Finally at my visit (4 years after all the trouble started) last week after having gone a little more in depth with him about my symptoms and him conferring with his colleagues he feels I have IBS-C. It hasn't been a confirmed diagnosis yet as he has a couple tests he'd like to run yet but it seems to fit. I had been looking in my off time to see how my symptoms compared to other GI disorders (Crohn's, UC, etc) they were similar but never quite matched it. After having read the stories on this site and others I'm confident I finally know what I have, which itself is a HUGE relief. Knowing is half the battle. Now I need to focus on controlling my symptoms. Something I've neglected for the most part these last few years. I would eat and drink what I want which often ended badly, but I was at home so it was of little concern. Now that I'm trying to get my life back on track I really need to focus on what I can and can't ingest. On top of that I have an issue with using public restrooms; something I've had issue with my whole life. Furthermore when I have a BM I'm usually in the can a good hour to hour and a half. I don't want to tie up a public restroom that amount of time, I won't even do it at family/friend's home. Even worse, is I have the anxiety that many seem to have along with IBS, but for me I have to shower after a BM. Not matter how thorough I am, it's just not enough.

597,"I have been suffering from IBS for many years. It had restricted my life to the extent that I would get depressed. I could do some activities, if I knew there was a bathroom available. But traveling presented a problem and I would get angry because of my limitations. I kept this all to myself and my husband suffering alone. I tried biofeedback, and the nurse who was helping me thought I should see a psychiatrist, which I did. He put me on an SNRI which changed my life... to about 80 % normal. My focus is no longer on the worry that comes with IBS. My life has become freer, but on the downside, I've begun to ‘what if’ again, so we may have to increase the dosage. So, yes, there is some help out there. – Name withheld by request",,activity,toilet,husband,nurse,psychiatrist,request,,,,
598,"I was diagnosed with IBS about 7 years ago, after a lifetime (I'm 55) of upset stomachs, diarrhea, bloating, constipation & gas. I've been reading some of your stories, and they are so familiar! I can laugh at some of my experiences now, although back then they were pretty terrible - like the time when I was 17 when I farted really badly in front of a boy I particularly wanted to impress. It took me years to get over the embarrassment. The hard part, I know, is that IBS affects everyone in different ways. A few years ago I cut all except for very pure foods out of my diet, and gradually reintroduced potentially problematic foods. I've found I have a very low tolerance for dairy foods, especially milk. Milk powder is used as a filler in a huge variety of products from mayonnaise to cookies. I stand in the supermarket and read lists of contents on packets these days. I don't drink coffee or aerated/carbonated drinks. The good news is I can eat fruit, vegetables, meat and eggs and soy milk. I bake my own bread and cakes when I can. So I manage a varied and interesting diet. For a dinner out, I find Asian food (but not Indian) is reasonably safe. On the alcohol front, I rarely drink beer or aerated/carbonated wines like champagne, but I find spirits such as Scotch with water or ice (not coke or dry ginger) can be quite soothing, in small quantities. My main point in writing is that having had IBS for most of my life, I’ve found it possible to live a full and varied life. I have a career (I'm an accountant), I've been married, I've had three children. I've also traveled, taking my diarrhea tablets with me. I use an off-the-shelf brand which works for me, and I make sure I always carry them. When I arrive at a new place I usually have an IBS episode, but once that passes, I'm fine. Two things I regard as essential – drinking lots of water, and exercise, even if it's only walking. Both definitely have helped me. I have long periods where, provided I stick to my diet, I have virtually no symptoms. – Jennie",,food,diet,carbonated drink,coke,Asian,Indian,Indian,alcohol,front,front

I seriously can relate to every single person’s problem on this website whether it is people telling you that your stomach problems are from stress, or that it’s just in your head, or people just totally not understanding the severity of the pain. For a long time I really thought that my problem could not just be IBS, that it must be something worse but after a colonoscopy and several other tests come back negative I just decided to agree with the doctors.

600,"I don’t remember exactly when I began noticing IBS symptoms, but I can recall an incident from the 8th grade: I was sitting in class, experiencing intense and unrelenting gas pains, feeling like my gut would explode, and trying to act like it wasn’t MY “stomach” making those strange noises. For a shy adolescent in a new school, it was a painfully embarrassing incident. Unfortunately, it was only the first of thousands that I can recall. For most of my 50-something years I have not talked about my problem. Gastrointestinal problems aren’t the kind of thing one wants to discuss on a date, with colleagues, or even with friends and family. At most, I had ""a nervous stomach"" or certain foods ""didn't set well with me."" Because I didn't talk about the problem, I felt isolated and never knew that others shared some of my experiences with IBS. And I didn’t know what to call it until I was finally diagnosed just a few years ago with IBS-C. This is what happens to me during a typical IBS Attack: I begin to feel gas building up, then comes the discomfort, then the sharp pains, followed soon by a feeling of urgency to get to a bathroom. Once there, I sometimes immediately have a bowel movement, usually “explosive” in nature (making me very glad the toilet was only steps away!), but sometimes nothing happens. Those times, I go back to whatever I was doing until the urgency returns, usually within minutes, so I stay close to the bathroom. Most occurrences result in several hours of alternating between bed and bathroom. While on the toilet, I typically begin to perspire, eventually to the point where sweat pours down my face, and my whole body becomes sweaty. This will continue for a few minutes, during which time I’ll have a bowel movement. The times when I’ve been constipated are the worst: the buildup of waste in my gut over a period of weeks results in terrible pain and strain in trying to get it out. It is hard and pellet-like. It gets to my rectum and stops! This is the most embarrassing of my secrets about IBS: often, I have to “dig it out” with my finger in order to get things started moving. (If I don’t, I end up sitting and straining for an hour or more, so that I now have hemorrhoids.) I keep a container of Vasoline nearby to lubricate my finger. Even without the existence of constipation, however, I sometimes end up sitting and straining as I experience colon “spasms” that last for 30 minutes or more. Eventually, I feel it is safe to stand up. Then, damp and dizzy, I stagger to my bed and collapse, suddenly freezing, until the next wave of pain and urgency hits. This will usually happen within 5 minutes. I race back to the toilet, sometimes just in time, for another BM accompanied by pain, sweat, dizziness, and often nausea. Because I can’t get up to vomit into the toilet, I have a plastic trash can standing by. If I’ve recently eaten, it all comes up and I may vomit numerous times over several minutes. Even with an empty stomach, I’ll vomit bile for several minutes. I believe it’s the pain that makes me nauseated. When I feel it’s safe, I’ll go back to my bed, although there have been many times I’ve gotten on the bathroom floor, until I have to get back on the toilet. After I’ve gone back and forth for several hours, the worst of the attack will be over. Then I must stay in bed, usually freezing and feeling weak and exhausted, for another hour. I can’t seem to get my hands and feet warm and, even though I’m hot-natured and typically keep the A/C turned down to 65, I’ll crank the heat up until I return to normal. Stress is definitely a trigger but not the only one. Certain foods and drinks, when and how much I eat, lack of sleep, fatigue – all triggers. Sometimes I'll eat nothing but Saltine crackers for days, and still have an attack. Maybe it’s my imagination, but symptoms seem to be getting worse as I head toward my 60’s - there are more occurrences, and the length and severity of attacks seem to have increased, too. Could it just be that the normal problems of a 50-something body - weight gain, arthritis, insomnia, menopause – are magnifying IBS? My life is stressful and more complicated these days, so maybe that’s the reason. Anyway, living with IBS is a humbling experience, a total lack of control over your body and your life. IBS is debilitating, humiliating, and painful. There’s no cure, little to nothing can be done to counteract or even control symptoms, and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. – Name withheld by request",,toilet,pain,bed,attack,attack,attack,attack,body,stomach,incident
601,"I was diagnosed with IBS in 2004. Pain in the abdomen, gas, bloating, belching, burping, sudden urges to the bathroom seems too much to handle. Very frustrating.

I suffer from this every day of my life, some are worse than others, stopping me from going to work at times. Some days I just feel like crying, as I am so sick of not feeling normal, and being able to eat what I want. I drink coffee, smoke, and am a worrier and stressed person, all of which don’t help. I suppose I am aware that there is probably some things I could try/eliminate, but if I ate what they say will help and not ate what they say not to, I feel like I would be giving up so much.

603,I was officially diagnosed with IBS today. I knew that there has been something going on with me for many years and it has always been a very embarrassing subject with me. I have had tummy problems for as long as I can remember and my hubby just thinks it's all in my head. I am 31 years old and I have a daughter that I'm pretty sure is going to have the same problem as me. This has just made me totally depressed because I know that I am not alone but I am alone within my family because no one understands what I am going through. My husband gets upset if I tell him that he has to watch our daughter for awhile because I'm ‘camping out’ in the bathroom for hours.

604,"I've been following this site for several months and have decided to share my IBS journey. I am in my 60's and my IBS symptoms started in my early 30's. It has steadily progressed over the years and pretty much controls my life now. I've seen many doctors over the years and feel I have a very good Gastroenterologist now. But, there is just so much he can do. All of your experiences are ones I have gone through at some time during the past 30 years. I've had all the tests and medications to treat it without very good results. I have also had several bouts of diverticulitis which sets me back in getting my life together again. Four months ago my doctor suggested trying a probiotic. I had tried other ones before but finally found one which worked really well. Then after six weeks I fell and broke my leg and the trauma set my colon off to where now seven weeks later I cannot get to feeling good again. The constant discomfort, nausea, and changes in bowel movement and some bleeding has me worried that something else is going on. The doctor says it is just bad IBS and I should take what I need to get through is. I too am waiting for someone to come up with something new to help with this terrible condition. My husband of 48 years is very understanding but very healthy and this also affects him because of my frequent down time. It's become a regular quick stop when we get into the car to go somewhere. For some reason it triggers my bowels and we don't get very far before I have to find the nearest bathroom.

605,"I have had symptoms since age 10, and am now 55 years old. I always attributed it to IBS, but just last an endocrinologist tested me and confirmed that I have Celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease brought on by severe allergy to wheat and gluten, which causes the body to attack the intestines, destroying their ability to absorb nutrients. My symptoms also mimicked IBS: the hours and hours of cramping, attacks of terrible diarrhea. Stress just made everything much worse. I would advise anyone with IBS to explore the possibility of Celiac disease, which requires - initially - a simple blood test to detect. Some doctors go on to intestinal biopsy as another tool, but my biopsies were inconclusive, while the blood test was glaringly positive!

606,"I am a 48 year old Registered Nurse who has been living with eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) for 6 years. It is a very debilitating disease and one that is very difficult for anyone who has not suffered with it to understand. Our entire culture is based on food. Picnics, business lunches, church socials, going ‘out’ to dinner, holiday feasts, just about everything that we do to socialize is based on food. I on the other hand would never eat again if I could. Eating is something that I have to force myself to do. I never know which bite of food will be the one to cause me to start the hours long ordeal of throwing up followed by severe stomach spasms. When I go through an ‘episode’ I usually don't consume more than about 2,000 calories over a 7 to 10 day period. My average weight loss is 5 to 7 lbs. Of course when I resume the corticosteroid medication I take I put weight on without even eating. Ironic isn't it. I pray that I can find an alternative treatment for controlling the symptoms so I can stop taking the medication. It is causing me a lot of problems.

It was a fine day in the year 2008 & I was in my high school then at that time. Everything was fine before the break. I had my snacks and after some 30 min I felt huge rumbling in my stomach. Within few minutes, I had developed a huge tummy and it felt very heavy. I had to use lavatory for 5 times that day. Since then my life got ruined as despite controlling my diet, I had diarroehaic tendency along with huge gas production along with flatulence. I developed phobia going outside and had to use toilet several times before going out of my home.

I have consulted almost all renowned GI specialists throughout the country and undergone complete diagnostics, which indicated that I have IBS and GI functional disorders. All these have made me very depressed over the years as I am unable to regain a good health. I live alone and I guess all these nuisance gives me anxiety which aggravates the problem.

I've always been very apprehensive about using medication to treat this awful condition, particularly Nexium because I've read a lot about the long-long side effects, so I tried to modify my diet to avoid the constant burping, heartburn and sleeplessness I have been experiencing for years after eating almost anything. Recently I've made some very simple changes to what I eat and drink and the effects have been dramatic. I've never had more than one coffee a day but I've given that up and voila! A significant reduction in burping and reflux. I followed that with eliminating oranges. That really helped too. But the biggest difference has been at night. A half a cup of fresh kefir taken a couple of hours before bed seems to soothe and coat my oesophagus so I'm able to lie comfortably on my side and sleep through the night without all the terrible discomfort I've suffered in the past. I cultivated the kefir myself using full cream milk and fresh kefir grains. GERD is a dreadful condition and a very dangerous one, too.

My mom assumed it was a stomach bug and sent me on my way.  Now I was already a little underweight for my age and always had been.  By the end of camp I had lost 11 pounds.  A 71 pound 13 year old girl.  Camp was a tough struggle and I was constantly in and out  the nurses office.  I had horrible stomach pain, burning, and nausea.  I began to have a mentality that if I didn't eat, I couldn't throw up... The nurses eventually got concernced as the summer progressed.  They sat me down and told me they were worried that I had an eating disorder.  I sobbed for over an hour after this.  I didn't care about my weight at all.  I felt sad and alone because they made it seem like everything was in my mind and that my pain wasn't real.  one of my counselors came in and said that she had an eating disorder when she was little and that she knows how it's rough.  That made me feel even worse.  She now sat next to me at meals and told that if I didn't eat they would send me to a facility like her when she was my age to treat me.  This terrified me and made me even more sad.  She thought I was lying.  Then the camp finally took me to a hospital.  The doctors said I simply had functional dyspepsia and gave me Pepcid.  It worked for 2 weeks then stopped.  When I got home i had every test done in the book- endoscopy, colonoscopy, endless blood work, and more.  My parents eventually put me into CBT.  It was torturous for me to say the least.  my parents say that I was too young to understand it.  I started seeing a therapist who put me on medication that really helped.  paroxitine and mirtazipine.  Fast forward a few months and I started seeing a GI doctor at a children's hospital.  Then the puzzle pieces came together when I began to get mucus in my poop.  I was officially diagnosed with IBS.  That day was amazing, and i realized that despite what some people said, I wasn't making everything up.  I'm still learning to live with this, and its bit easy.  i still get nausea attacks and flare ups every now and then.  But trust me- it has to get worse before it gets better.",,mother,camp,weight,disorder,nausea,pain,nurse,pound,pound sterling,weight
616,"I am 46 years old, not overweight, and I am taking the time to post to this forum because I felt really really hopeless along my journey to be free of GERD, and after making specific changes in my diet, I now feel nearly completely cured of my reflux (which manifested not as heartburn but as a burning in my throat and a choking sensation). But, just 6 months ago, I was so desperate I was considering having surgery, I was at such a loss. Even though I was taking prescription strength Nexium, my GERD had become worse than ever. But let me back up. Three years ago, I woke up one morning with a very watery mouth. My saliva was in overdrive. I also felt like I was choking or that I was about to choke. This sensation caused me to feel very panick-y, as EVERYTHING I ate seemed to exacerbate this sensation. I began to wonder if perhaps I was having an allergic reaction to the food I was eating, even though I hadn't been allergic before. I considered going to the ER that night, after a day of this feeling, but I didn't. I tried to remain calm, and I called my doctor the next morning. After visiting briefly with her, she referred me to a GI doctor. I met with the GI doctor who put me on Dexilant, which worked to totally erase my symptoms in about 48 hours to alleviate the choking sensation (brought on by the Vagus nerve; I wasn't actaully choking). The GI doctor performed an endoscopy within a couple of weeks, and I was diagnosed with esophagitis. Also, my sphincter was OPEN! He said I would likely have reflux problems all my life, and that the medication would help, but I might have to have surgery down the line. I felt really hopeless!! He said I should have a repeat endoscopy in two years. I began to develop a skin rash from the Dexilant, so he put me on Nexium, which also worked, and which I stayed on for the entire next year. Fast forward a year. That doctor retired, and my GERD was back and worse than ever. The medication wasn't working anymore. The new GI doctor told me to double up on the medication. (Which was already expensive, and I was worried about side effects of prolonged PPI use.) He told me not to worry about extended PPI use. Just double up to 80mg of Nexium a day. When I said that I wanted to get to the REAL bottom of this thing, he said I should try some enteric peppermint capsules. I wasn't sure if he was being sarcastic or not. He didn't seem to be hearing me. I did try the capsules, though, and they did nothing. But I didn't want to double up on my meds, so I didn't.  I just kept taking the 40mg of Nexium and lived with the reflux. For a YEAR more! Well, at this point, I was taking Nexium AND going through bottles of Tums/Rolaids/Gaviscon and anything else I read about. I tried digestive enzymes, probiotics, drinking vinegar before meals (not recommended!), DGL, aloe vera juice, kombucha, fermented foods, all the advice from every blog out there. If anything worked, it did not work for me, at least not consistently or for long. But then, someone somewhere on the web recommended the book The Acid Watcher Diet by Jonathan Aviv. So, I read it. I also read Dr. Jamie Koufman's Acid Reflux Diet, which was recommended by Amazon when I bouth Dr. Aviv's book. Both of these books will scare the hell out of you when it comes to esophogeal cancer! And both of these books suggest similar stratagies: Eat no acid. This seems like a no brainer in hindsight, but a lot of educated people on the Internet will tell you need MORE acid when you have reflux. I know now, this was NOT my case. I had thought I had cut out most of the offenders from my diet already. I hadn't had coffee in three years. I had limited my tea to two cups per day. I wasn't drinking margaritas. I wasn't eating bad food. In fact, I was eating healthy food. But guess what: I was still eating some really acidic healthy food (I'm looking at you turkey-black bean chili!) without thinking about it. At any rate, I had been having pretty nonstop GERD that seemed to have come out of nowhere for 2.5 years, and I was getting really desperate. I felt that I was very near having surgery for the throat burn I was experiencing, as NOTHING was helping me.  The first thing I did was read both books in three days. I then purchased a wedge pillow from Amazon for 20 bucks. I bought a few gallons of alkaline water. For one month, I followed the acid-free diet to a T. The only fruit you can eat on the acid free diet is non-acidic fruit--bananas and melon. There are many acidic veggies I was eating, too, like nightshades (peppers, tomoatoes, egglplant). And no onions or garlic are allowed in the first phase. But, the hardest part was NO ALCOHOL (at least temporarily). And guess what. After three long weeks: NO REFLUX. AT ALL. I used fennel bulb in the place of onions and garlic. I stayed away from peppers, tomatoes , onions, and garlic (hard to do, since I live in Texas!). I didn't drink alcohol AT ALL. For a person who used to drink a nightly glass of wine or two, this was the hardest thing to give up.  After one month, I was able to drink A CUP OF COFFEE with NO ISSUES. I have switched from wine (which is really acidic) to 1-2 vodka martinis (vodka and tequila are the only alcohols that are neutral when not mixed with anything) a couple of nights a week. If I feel the slightest tinge of heartburn, I drink a glass of alkaline water and get back on the diet. My last endoscopy (a month ago) showed NO ESOPHAGITIS! I take NO MEDICATION. I take NO TUMS. I eat (mostly) what I want. I have moved on to the Maintenance phase of the acid-free diet (e.g., you can eat cooked onions and garlic), and I am able to ""cheat"" here and there with no problems with trigger foods like fried food, chocolate, and even a margarita once in a great while. The main point is that I NEVER thought I would be able to have relief from the reflux. So, I wanted to SHARE!!!! Be disciplined, and you will heal.

Right now I am following the therapy of the last gastrenterologist I consulted, who was the only one that did not doubted that my symptoms are real and even showed some empathy. With the nutritionist I tried the FODMAP diet but it did not worked so much for me.  Right now I am on psyllium, PPIs for the reflux and antispasmodics. I am considering on my own to start waking up every day at the same time, having breakfast, lunch etc. about the same time to figure out if a more scheduled eating program helps me feel better. My onle question is, could this work?  To be honest I do not know if i have any courage and strength reserves to fulfill this program on my own but I am gonna try it. Be strong people but if one day you start feeling too alone, helpless and depressed  SEEK HELP. It's not a shame. It's not being weak.

618,"I am 43 years old and I was told I have gastroparesis about 10 years ago.  When I was around 25 is when a tumor was found in my stomach which I had removed along with half my stomach at MD Anderson in Houston because it was thought to be cancer but it turned out it was not!! But my nausea and vomitting didn't go away and after many years of Dr's trying to figure out what was wrong I was told I had Gastroparesis.  After every meal I would get severe nausea and vomiting within about 1-2 hours after I would eat. I could hold no food down. I tried every medication possibe and had a gastric pacemaker surgically implanted with no relief. I tried every deit and every treatment they gave me and final I was in a bad way and they said I may have to have a feeding tube to help try and get some weight on me along with nutreints. That is a road I was going to try and avoid at all cost.  My dr really feels my illness was NOT caused by the surgery, he thinks the SSRIs for my mental illness are what caused it, that is his opinion there is no way to know for sure. He worked alot with Dr. Abel who basiclly is the expert when it comes to the gastric pacemaker. But anyway....  It has been over a year now since I started my new treatment and in that year + I may have vomitted 5 times!!! thats right I went from every meal I ate to 5 times in a year!! I was so happy and releived after all this time I found releif!!!  My dr. has turned off the pacemaker to save the battery that way if I need it can be turned back on (it didn't work before but I understand why he done this)  When I told him I wanted to turn it off he look at me like I was crazy but after I told him what I was doing he said it has been shown to be the best treatment for this awful thing. He told me he couldn't tell me to do it but did give me info from some of the very limited trails that have been on this and what he has seen. The CBD pill made no difference in the vomitting or nausea.  The state I live in doesn't allow this treatment but many do and I will be force to move in order to get legal treatment, luckly it not a huge move but still I shouldn't have to move but I am forced to do whats best for me and my family.  For me it's been a cure but some have different levels of success as with any treatment they give you.  I have to live and that's what I will do.  It took many years for me to even consider this but I was backed into a corner and I want my life back and at lest for now I have it!! If this treatment was given to me early om I wouldn't have false top teeth and half my bottom teeth missing.  Please don't suffer needlessly because you are worried about what people might think, it's your life and you have to make the best of it.

619,"I am 24 years old and I have been suffering with IBS for almost 10 years - and I wish I didn't have this ""invisible"" syndrome. The main issue I have with IBS is the debilitating pain that I face on a day to day basis. Long story made short ... I've tried every probiotic, vitamin and supplement probably known to man, I have gone to the Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota Gastroenterology department multiple times, seen too many different doctors to count, tried all holistic approaches, tried almost every medication out there, and I still am struggling on a day to day basis with the IBS pain. According to some of the doctors I have seen, the only two thing i haven't tried is taking Amitriptyline (antidepressant) I used to be in the hospital 5-8 times a month because no medication helped my IBS pain and the pain would get so bad that the hospital would be my only option. Eventually after a year of this going on, my primary doctor prescribed me Tramadol and what a god send that was. I was able to have a life, keep my job, go to events with family or friends, and never went to the hospital for my pain. Now my doctor wants to discontinue my use of Tramadol so I am back to square one. For 10 years I have tried everything I could and I have no idea what I am going to do, and it scares me. I came across this website hoping for some help. It's nice to know that I'm not alone with my struggles. It would be nice to hear advice or if anyone has tried Amitriptyline for their IBS.

621,"I have been dealing with gastrointestinal issues for nearly a year now after having the stomach flu in November 2016.  My symptoms were often upper and lower GI- constant diarrhea, stomach pain after eating, constant acid reflux, awful nausea, headaches, vomiting. April 2017 I took a turn for the worse and was puking every morning despite medications. I had an upper endoscopy done that showed chronic gastritis (who cares, 9 out of 10 people have gastritis).  Since then, my diarrhea has gotten better and due to medication, my stomach does not hurt all the time now.  The constant nausea is not as bad but the acid reflux has gotten extremely bad to the point where it burns my throat from sunup to sundown, it hurts to talk, it feels like my chest and throat are swollen. I was taking Protonix 40mg twice daily and it wasn't working after 6+ months on it. I am now on Dexilant which was working the first couple weeks after switching but now my symptoms are getting worse again. I also currently take Zantac 150 at night to help as well. I take Gaviscon Extra Strength as needed but notice no difference when taking it.  I have awful gas that comes after eating and before eating, it smells really bad and I don't think it is due to the medication as it started randomly when I had not changed any medication in awhile.  I am tired of feeling so sick and am looking for relief.  Blood work is normal, upper GI is normal otherwise, stool sample normal, ultrasound showed my intestinal structure is okay, HIPA test showed gallbladder function at 76 percent, and the next test will be a PH test but I am nervous to do that as I would have to be off my antacids for 2 weeks which I am thinking will make me feel miserable if I already feel miserable WITH prescription antacids.  I think I will have to take off work to do that test but it is the last test I am going to perform before talking to my doctor about getting surgery for the acid reflux symptoms. Esophageal surgery, I am thinking via an endoscope (rather than cutting open my beautiful stomach) would be the best bet. I hope my doctor agrees. I would like to not be on antacids much longer as I know about the detrimental negative side effects.  I want to get this cleared up or at least feel somewhat better before moving to Colorado in the summer of 2017. Wish me luck.",,exam,medication,stomach,acid,flux,gastritis,job,doctor,doctor,throat
622,"I am a 20 year old college student living in Iowa. In November of 2016, I got sick with the stomach flu. Since then, things deteriorated gastrointestinally. In December I was still having diarrhea and constant nausea, and so my family physician prescribed 40mg Protonix (pantoprazole) once daily. This helped a lot, and I would notice a difference in the morning if I waited too long taking my antacid.  I was still having symptoms like stomach pain, some nausea, acid reflux, irritable bowels.  However, at the end of March 2017, things took a turn for the worse. I woke up a few mornings in a row constantly puking. Nothing would make me feel better, I could not keep my anti-nauseas down. I lost 10 to 12 pounds from November to March.nd another 10 to 15 pounds from March to now. At the end of Summer  My doctor rushed the orders for an endoscopy. I had already gotten bloodwork done for celiac disease, lactose intolerance, H.Pylori, stool samples for bacteria, and everything came back clean and all within normal ranges.  My endoscopy showed chronic gastritis, and they bumped my Protonix up to 40 mg twice a day. This helped with the acid reflux but I was still nauseous every morning, eating hurt my stomach, and I had no appetite. I was prescribed Sulcrafate 4 times daily to manage the stomach pain from meals. It has been hard keeping up on that as I read it is best to eat smaller, more frequent meals during the day, which happens more than three times. I have to take the Sulcrafate an hour before a meal. It is not ideal.  I was not satisfied by the answer my doctor and the first Gastroenterologist had given me, and they had not given me any course of treatment. I went online and decided to change my lifestyle habits. I worked out a lot more, 4 times weekly, quit caffeine, don't smoke, don't eat fatty foods, cook for myself mostly every day, avoid gluten, drink lactaid, avoid overeating and eating too much chocolate, I sleep completely upright against the wall that my bed is on, and I take all medications as prescribed. Not much change.  I received a recommendation to see the University of Iowa Hospital Gastroenterologist, but the earliest appointment was three months away in September. I found another Gastro doctor who I was able to see in early September, while also keeping my late September U of I doctor.  The second Gastro, Dr. Z, told me that chronic gastritis is not really a diagnosis and that almost everyone could have it. He took a look at all the tests run and asked about a history of how it started. He is assuming that because of an exposure to a bacteria when I got sick with the flu in November, my upper GI system had gotten out of whack and that I have a functional gastrointestinal disorder. He prescribed 25mg Amitriptyline, as that medication messes with the serotonin and norepinephrine, which also has to do with your nervous system and could help my gastrointestinal disorder. I have been on it three weeks now and notice no difference except weight gain. Dr. Z is hopeful because he thinks I am doing better since April, as I have not thrown up in a couple months and no longer feel too nauseous. However the acid that is in my throat is constant, it is an awful burning pain that reaches my chest and my throat and feels like I have to puke or burp or something constantly. Little to no effect the antacids have, and little to no effect OTC chewables like Gaviscon have on it. It is constant and awful and I am sick and tired of it.  I lost another 10 to 15 pounds from March to now. At the end of Summer 2016 I was 155, 14 percent body fat. Now I am down to 5.9 percent body fat and 130 pounds, although slowly increasing due to new medication that increases appetite and also causes weight gain. Yet the acid reflux should be getting better, as many people are overweight and experience these symptoms. I was never really overweight and surely am not now.  I recently saw my third gastro at the U of I Hospitals, and he said unfortunately there was not a lot known about these gastro disorders. Which makes me more upset. However he asked about the amitryptaline, and asked if I had depression. When I answered yes (as I was diagnosed Freshman yaer of high school), he asked ""from what?"" Like, what kind of doctor asks what I'm depressed about? It is a chemical disorder, so I am not situationally depressed. Obviously I am upset about being so sick, but I also suffer from depression naturally so I was not sure how qualified he could be if he was asking such a dumb question like that.  The next test he wants me to do is a 24 hour PH monitor, but I have to be off my antacids for 2 weeks to do that, so I am reluctant to take that test. I am waiting to see if the amitryptaline works. Dr. Z seems to think that this goes away on its own, that I am getting better, and that the amitryptaline may take 4 to 6 weeks to work, like normal antidepressants do.  I am out of options. I am extremely tired living this way. Gastro #3 says some people have it forever. My parents read that many people experience symtoms forever. This is not a life I want to live and it has not even been a year dealing with these symtpoms. I am so lost and out of hope.",,stomach,disorder,acid,doctor,doctor,nausea,pain,flux,pound sterling,pound
623,"I’m currently in my mid-40s. Since I was in grade school, I’ve struggled with acid reflux - popping Tums and Rolaids every night for years, up through and beyond college. Then in my 20s, it got worse and I felt like I had a knot in my throat - food was getting stuck in my throat when I would eat.  I had an endoscopy done and was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. They said it was the diameter was too great for surgery- the doctor put me on Nexium and I’ve been taking it ever since.  It worked like a charm until about 4-5 years ago where out of nowhere I woke up choking on vile acid, unable to breathe and desperately trying to catch my breath and clear my throat.  From there, things got worse – many nights of waking up choking and gasping for air, feeling like it’s aspirated into my lungs and spending the next hour or two trying to gently cough and clear my throat/lungs of the burning/vile acid without throwing up, painful projectile vomiting, and many sleepless nights of sitting up straight to prevent another episode.  My throat is likely damaged as I can hear a weezing sound when I deeply exhale.  Over the years, I've done lots of research on my issue and have received tons of solicited and unsolicited advice as to how to best treat it.  To add confusion, there's much conflicting information as to whether GERD is due to too little/too much acid and what is the best treatment, aside from completely eliminating trigger foods from one's diet.  What I do know, however, is that once I started taking about 1-2 tablespoons of Braggs apple cider vinegar mixed with honey (for taste) and about 6-8 oz of water each night before bed, I have not experienced any nightly choking episodes.  I drink it through a straw to minimize contact with my teeth.  I pair this with not eating my known trigger foods late in the evening (like cutoff around 7 pm) – this includes tomato based foods, greasy foods, spicy foods, pasta and cream based sauces, heavy carbs, chocolate, alcohol, dairy and ice cream, etc (in sum, all of my favorite foods).  Since I travel frequently for work, I also purchased Apple Cider Vinegar pills which are easy to take while on the road. They seem to be just as effective.  Now that I’m more aware of the damage that PPIs can cause when used long term, I hope to ween off and utilize the apple cider vinegar solution, or at least a lower dosage of the PPI and/or one that is less damaging.  Having a family history of osteoporosis, the importance of getting off PPIs is even more important.  I’ve tried to stop taking Nexium cold turkey before but that didn’t work out well – so for the time being, I’m continuing to take 40 mg generic Nexium (Esomeprazole) every morning and drink my apple cider vinegar concoction at night. In the meantime I’ve scheduled with a new GI doctor and plan to get an endoscopy and acid test done – and hopefully one day, I will be free of PPIs.",,food,throat,acid,cider,apple,acid test,long term,ice cream,doctor,doctor

626,"I have had upper GI problems since birth. Despite maintaining a pretty healthy diet (according to a nutritionist) all of my life, my problems increased and got worse after I turned 50. Even so, I still want to be as active as possible, and help others if I can.  A bit more history:  I've struggled with IBS since age 29 (when I became pregnant); my problem is mainly sudden, urgent needs to evacuate and occasional loose stools, rarely constipation. Diverticulosis was found at age 40, but my colonoscopy at age 52 was normal. Around 10 lbs overweight, I was diagnosed with GERD at age 53 and had difficulties with several medications; finally found some relief with Tagamet. (Also greatly reduced the amount of fat and acidic foods/drinks in my diet, and lost weight.) My main GERD symptom is the ""lump in the throat"" sensation, and doctors ruled out all other potential causes of that feeling, including allergies and muscle tension.  About 6 months after the GERD diagnosis, I was hospitalized due to diverticulitis with a microperforation. I followed my doctor's orders about diet, etc. to the letter, but had another attack 4 months later, then another, then one 30 days later.  Surgery was scheduled, and I started having yet another attack, so it was moved up. They removed a foot of colon (laparoscopic surgery); I had no complicatons (or bag) and have recovered well.  It's now been almost 9 weeks since my surgery and I've had no recurrence of diverticulitis.  I consume more fiber, though I doubt that it's ""enough."" Still, I have a lot of hope now.  I guess what I want to emphasize is to not be afraid of diverticulitis surgery, if it comes to that. But, be sure you consult a surgeon who specializes in colo-rectal surgery, not a general surgeon. Don't be too hard on yourself, either, if you do everything right and your body doesn't cooperate.

How do you feel when a episode occurs?    What are your personal symptoms?     My stomach feels bad and I feel bad. Some symptoms are aches, chills, and stomach pains. Hot showers do help when I am sick because they suppress my symptoms for a little bit. It is not very fun, but I do like being sick around once a month so I’m not sick all the time.    Do you feel like people don't understand what you are going through?    I sometimes feel like people don’t understand me just because not many people have it and it is different for everyone.    Do you feel like you have any limitations?    Not really, unless I have to miss certain occasions because of it, which I do.    Do friends ever ask you any questions?    Do they understand what you going through?     Some of my really good friends ask questions so I feel like they do. They ask why I wasn’t at school that day so I feel like they have some understanding of it.  5. What do you think people should know about Eosinophilic Esophagitis and/or Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome?    Well, neither are fun, especially Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. You should just push through and never give up.

630,"My name is Josh and I am a fellow IBS-SIBO Survivor. Like a lot of people I’ve struggled with the digestive disease throughout my life. I’ve been at a point where it was hard seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I have managed being a college baseball player, moving across the country, and graduating from college. By no means was this easy and I could have given up. Learning to treat and manage SIBO was a struggle and I often found myself lonely and in a dark state of mind trying anything to feel better. I understand the silent suffering that people with this disease experience.  My story started a number of years ago when I came down with nasty digestive symptoms while in college. I recall a bad episode of food poisoning which may have helped trigger the condition. It was most likely a combination of genetics, altered gut flora, and food poisoning which contributed to the disease. It’s very difficult to pinpoint the exact causes. Anyway, I began to have the typical symptoms like excessive gas/bloating, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, and the feeling of being infected. These symptoms were very severe, and like most people, I tried everything possible to feel better. It was devastating, especially as a younger kid in college.  I’ve struggled to keep relationships, skipped classes, had gut attacks in the worst places like on a plane or at an important event. I’ve been through periods of depression. There was a time period where I ate nothing but chicken and carrots for 3 months straight and turned orange! I had to self-teach myself to get through college and had a hard time sitting through a full class. It was definitely a struggle.  Getting sick also killed my childhood dream of becoming a pro baseball player. I know what it feels like to have your confidence and hope stripped out from under you. I have found it fascinating how your gut affects your mood, energy, brain function, and much more. Going from a strong college baseball player to someone who lost 20 pounds and sat on the bench because his strength was zapped was tough.  Since coming down with the disease I have seen numerous top doctors, tried many treatment options both natural and pharmaceutical, and have experimented with many different remedies. To this day I attend the live webinars on SIBO and IBS to find out the latest research. Through education, great doctors, and my own study and experimentation I have improved to the point where I can enjoy life a lot more than before! I am able to eat a wider range of foods, socialize with friends more often, and begin to dream of living an extraordinary life again. At my lowest points it was hard to imagine getting better since it seemed like nothing was helping my body heal.  I definitely still struggle but I am able to manage my symptoms much more effectively than in the past through diet, medication, and treatment. I have learned a lot since getting sick and it has helped shape me into a different person which I’m thankful for. I believe there is always hope and look forward to new treatments and discoveries for IBS-SIBO sufferers in the future. I encourage anyone going through something similar not to give up. Find doctors who truly care and continue to do everything you can to get better. Remember that improving takes time and there is hope.  To share more about my story and everything that I’ve learned on my journey I created SiboSurvivor.com where I plan to create some awesome content and products for the community. My goal is to experiment and find ways to improve quality of life with the condition. I would love it if you checked it out.

631,"This body is 62. I am fit, slim and active. In the past I was much the same. My mum tells me I almost died within weeks of my birth in Bristol UK. I was throwing up all the time; every feed was emptied efficiently, as a result I was starving to death. I had been read last rites in the hospital (not that I understood!). My mum was paying what she thought might be her last visit to the family doctor and on his desk was a ‘glue-like’ food sample, a tester that arrived in the mail for no particular reason. Perhaps an oats mix? It was ‘luck’. Within days of taking this my body started to keep food down, as it had no choice, and I grew and thrived. It seemed the crisis was over, and the cause was never explored any further. Maybe I had just developed a poor gastric reflex at this impressionable age and the glue-food broke that reflex? Maybe I was initially reactive (sensitive) to the manufactured milk feed given to me and this new food just had different ingredients? My mum was never sure and I think she was just so relieved that I survived. I do not have more detail than that, but always wondered light heartedly if I should sue a rather large ‘x’ baby food company!  Moving on. When excited or nervous I often noticed my stomach was painful or felt very tight. I also often sweated a little more than other kids, but never explored this issue. As a child I was slim, fit and active. However, if I tried to run any long distance I quickly developed a ‘stitch’ that stopped me, as I couldn’t breathe properly and I gasped away, stumbling about on the running field. I always presumed it was my diaphragm going into spasm, because that was what I was told as a child.  As a young adult I occasionally got that same pain or discomfort and tightness when driving or nervous. I brushed it off and thankfully did not require medications or special foods. It seemed to be helped by the simple act of placing pressure over my lower sternum with one hand as I drove with the other. I could eat and drink anything, and I did!  In my forties I became a very fit, slim and active therapist, my kids were growing fast and we had a set of exercise rings with blue plastic handles set up on our deck outside just for fun. We live in the countryside, built our home in wood and enjoyed every out door activity there was.  We all loved cycling, canoeing, long distance wilderness walks, camping and swimming. Life was good to us and we spent very little time watching the boring TV. One day I was just fooling about, having fun with the kids as usual, upside down on those rings and I felt something ‘give’ I felt a mild ‘teasing apart’ sensation at my diaphragm level. I immediately stopped and rested. “That was dumb, no more rings for a few days,” I thought.  It took me a few years to completely realise that my growing discomfort and poor sleep was something I needed help for. I do not like asking for help, and it took me even longer before I went to my doctor. My doctor, a kind and intelligent person, was not all that understanding. This injury was something he didn’t give much credence. He believed in a different story. A story from his own medical texts. Certainly he was very brisk about examination and arriving at a diagnosis. He was sure I just had what everyone else has –reflux. No real examination of my diaphragm has ever been made. His cure was a sale, a simple pill for a physical injury. As you can tell I am not all that enamored with this approach.  The years have passed, and I have been on and off these darn pills for years. They certainly help with the acid reflux. My injury has matured; I feel the cause has not ever been examined fully. The persistent mild reflux has grown worse on occasions and devastating on other occasions. At its worst my sleep is destroyed for days, weeks, and I feel as if I will collapse. My legs feel as if they will just fail to support me. I had to give up my job as it became difficult to physically continue, I was exhausted from poor sleep and constant discomfort and pain. A lot of the job entails repetitive bending which just made my reflux worse. I am given proton pump inhibitors and offered nothing else. Once the sale has been made to me, I am considered ‘cured’ by my doctor. No further attempts at a deeper understanding are ever made by him.  It is not that he doesn’t care, it is just that he is being honest, he knows of nothing else that could help.  I have seen two specialists. One was clearly near retirement and, after a barium drink and x-ray, I was offered a stomach operation that seemed a little brutal. His replies to my questions were never answered directly and he treated me as an uneducated client that needed to behave. The next specialist was a kind younger man who listened. He arranged for me to spend one day walking about with an acid monitor inserted into my lower esophagus. It was a surprisingly comfortable and interesting experience. Unfortunately is has been difficult to tease any further information from this examination and I walked away from it with the same label, no detailed additional anatomical understanding of my particular situation. It has been frustrating.  As the acids take their toll the local autonomic nerves get more dysfunctional, more reactive. My LES becomes more dysfunctional and irritated. My reflux becomes more awkward to manage. My voice has changed. I have found in the past that if I build up my strength in my diaphragm my symptoms are often nearly gone. However life is not a straight line, maintaining perfect extra exercises or eating those perfectly sized and timed meals, charting my sleep patterns. This all helps, but it does not cure because we still do not know the root cause(s).  Today I was woken at 4am despite sleeping upright in my firm and comfortable sofa for the last four nights. I have taken the PPI’s and an anti acid drink. It still aches and keeps me up.  I wish I had more say in the direction the medical testing procedures went, and I would love to help develop a few of my own.  Labeling this as ‘a condition’ with an expected natural life cycle that cannot be altered is not anything more than observing our inability to cure. Present pills for reflux do not resolve the deeper issues.  Pills are therefore a sale that represents a superficial relationship between the patient and the doctor.  There is a clear lack of scale and relevance in the present examinations used both in general medical practice and in the hospitals. Acid reflux and GERD are terms used, but no one knows why it occurs because there are no instruments that have ever been developed that fully and accurately sample what is going on inside our bodies. The diagnosis of GERD is a dysfunctional one. The pills trap both patients and doctors into a prolonged slow decline that involves them in yet another doctor-patient relationship that is superficial at best. We need to follow a new path. I would like to solve this hidden dysfunction and stop future generations from having to experience the same prolonged illness and injury. I would love to give my doctor the tools to enable her to develop a real understanding of cause, to empower him or her and make their hearts sing too.",,doctor,doctor,flux,food,pill,acid,diaphragm,diaphragm,diaphragm,exam

634,"I was about 19 when I had my gall bladder out.  The sergeon said that it had merged with my liver.  With the antibiotics, I had lost my gut bacteria, and I was perpetually sick after eating for about 10 years.  My brother bought me a natural digestive cleanse, and I got a lot better.  My digestion was normal... until... About 6 months ago, I went to a naturopathic doctor just to see if anything was up with me.  I was feeling a little light headed as I stood up.  He took my blood and told me that my heart was weak (no surprise as I'm fat, 6'2, 300 lbs, and have a desk job) and that my liver was toxic.  He put me on serapeptase and metacrin-dx for my liver.  Apart from breaking out with pimples, I was fine for a couple weeks.  Then I got sick with the flu.  It felt like I would throw up the nothing that I had eaten.  I asked my daughter to get me food, so she brought me carrots.  I was too lazy to get anything else, so I ate too many.  It felt like my stomach was clogged.  It was at that point that I felt like my heart attack-like symptoms began.  It hurt worse than any time since I've had GERD symptoms.  Since my natural Dr. told me my heart was weak, I worried, which made it worse.  Of course, I went to Google.  It said that if I exercise and it gets worse, go to the ER.  I did, it got better.  I looked at my feet, which didn't look swollen.  The pain was in the center of my chest and not radiating.  I took an antacid and it got better.  I felt justified in going to my natural Dr. for the emergency, and his MD understudy said I have GERD.  They told me that I need to cut out wheat.  Half of his office didn't eat wheat, so I thought that he probably over-prescribed that.  I got an MD second opinion at an urgent care.  They agreed that it was GERD, gave me something to slow my HCL production, and sent me home.  That helped, but didn't fix it, so I went back to be absolutely sure it wasn't my heart.  My regular MD took my blood and confirmed it was GERD.  He gave me a referral to a GI.  At this point, I'm torn between my natural Dr.'s path and the GI.  Maybe I'll update this later. Since the symptoms started, I've found many things that ease the pain.  Antacids when my stomach is empty, pickles when it's full.  Leaning forward instead of lounging back helps. If I prop myself up on a big pillow on my right arm, it helps me to burp.  I bought a kneeling chair so I can lean forward.  Bending in half is bad.  I bought a juicer and started to make veggie soup, especially with cabbage, and that meal doesn't hurt.  I cut out wheat, dairy, spicy, minty, and a few others, and that helps.  I've taken to eating dates. I eat less more often.  I drink lots of Naked Juice and Kern's.  I get a lot more exercise.  I walk every day, and I do 30-50 jumping jacks after I go to the bathroom.  I've lost 30 pounds.  All this makes GERD about 20% pain max, and I am still looking for more ideas.",,doctor,doctor,liver,Doctor of Medicine,pain,heart,blood,stomach,urgent care,myocardial infarction
635,"Aaron has made great strides to raise awareness and funds for IBS research. The first annual IBS 5K Run/Walk for Hope was held in Allentown, Pennsylvania in October of 2016. Thank you, Aaron.  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can sometimes be a hopeless cause. Myself, along with other individuals I personally know, have struggled living with this diagnosis. There is no known cure, and it often seems to be brushed to the side since it is not a life or death condition. I know a handful of people who are misinformed about the root causes of IBS, along with lifestyle changes people need to make. So just imagine how many others are not knowledgeable on the subject. I have had people comment to me mistakenly thinking IBS is strictly a ""mental issue.""  As my knowledge grew of IBS, I realized that here is a medical condition affecting millions of people, yet the voice is so small. So many people are suffering, but my research into ""IBS charity events"" found little to nothing. I believe all these patients need more attention, which is why I decided to create a charity event called the ""IBS 5K Walk/Run for Hope"" with proceeds going to the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) for further medical research.  This now annual event is a place where all are invited to support IBS awareness! The main mission of the event is to bring together a community of IBS patients and supporters to raise awareness and have fun! I want those with IBS to realize they have caring supporters behind them. The first event was located in Allentown, Pennsylvania in October of 2016. I had a few local businesses provide some gifts! The sponsors were CrossFit South Mountain, St. Luke's Hospital, and Blendlife food truck. Staying healthy and fit is a way to help ease IBS symptoms, which is why all the sponsors fit into this.  I believe that having a good relationship with other people with IBS or even another health condition is a great way to ease stress. It provides the chance to talk to others experiencing the same everyday problems. My older sibling, and a person with IBS, has always been my go-to if I need to express any pain I'm experiencing, because he knows firsthand how I feel. I want to build together that community of people so we as patients have the feeling of knowing we are not the only ones out there with this and we have supporters behind us! Life can be hard and seem unfair at times, but if we have patients filled with perseverance and supporters making sure you get right up after you fall, then we cannot fail!

636,"Hello my name is Amy my daughter Briana is 17 with Gastroparesis, GERD and irritable bowel.  She has had stomach problems off and on her whole life.  She has had 16 surgeries and 2 of them were open heart surgeries.  Because of the open heart surgeries she has GERD and off and on Esophgitis.  The past couple years she would get sick from eating and drinking.  All the doctors said it was anxiety and in her head.  I was not sure what to believe.  I always took her to the doctors and they couldn't find anything.  About 3 months ago my daughters pediatrician referred us to  gastro doctor at U of M Motts Children's Hospital.  Right away she thought Briana had a delay.  About 3 weeks ago she did the gastric emptyimg scan.  It showed she has a delay in her liquids.  The test was about 5 hours.  She did the food and liquids.  It makes total sense now because whenever we went out to eat she would drink her fluids and then get sick where she couldn't eat.  We had no clue at the time.  Briana is having a very hard time. She can't drink and is become dehydrated all the time.  The doctors started her on 3 new meds.  Because she can't do liquids she  is going to be doimgIV fluids once or twice a week. Is theee any one else with liquid form of Gastroparesis?  Because it's the liquid form she does mor qualify for any of the procedures.  We are not sure what to do about this.  It's new to us and we are trying to learn everything we can.  Is there other sites or more information?",,doctor,doctor,liquid,surgery,heart,delay,stomach,open,couple,anxiety

638,"Well this story is about my child. At a few months old constipation became an issue that would come and go. Up to age 3 we treated this by the pediatricians recommendations with suppositories, v8 splash, senna a list of things. The suppositories we not pleasant of course and we just kind of backed off everything. Things seemed better, life and Mom-brain took over. So over the next several years it was all ""forgotten"" but yet my healthy thriving child ALWAYS had a stomachache and had that distended baby belly look. Anyways fast forward and just over a year ago she woke up vomiting. She got sick 2 or 3 times that day and then she was fine. Exactly 1 week later fever, headache and severe vomiting started. She could sleep, eat, drink or lay down and eventually refused to move at all. Many doctor visits with pediatrician, urologist and GI and the diagnosis was IBS-C. This we have found out has been an issue her whole life :/ Over the next 12 months the constipation worsened and the encopresis was out of control. She was admitted for a bowel clean out via NG-GOlightly. Her bowels have shrunk a bit but still very full. She HATES all of it..meds, clean outs, using the bathroom, just everything. She is now a pre-teen which doesn't help. I also feel like people see her and think she is perfectly healthy or if she has to ""go"" just do it and she will be better. She has lost a lot of the signs to use the bathroom. It's overwhelming and I don't want to fail her. People have no clue what this is like..of course we could be worse. I remind myself that always.

640,"I'm really not completely bowel incon but after a hemacolectomy (removal of aprox 1' of decsending colon for concentrated diverticulum), I began to experience very severe urgency. It is such that even with a bathroom near by, I rarely make it. Every effort to use the toilet has resulted in soiled clothing and the difficult task of cleaning the bathroom. As you can imagine, this restricted my normal activities in the beginning, at least until I became more accepting of my situation and developed adequate ""protection"" for limited social activities. Doctors have told me that this problem presents in a small number of patients post-operatively and that it should slowly go away on its own. It was recommended that I use a bulk producing fiber supplement (Metamucil) to prevent further problems with diverticulitis. (was hospitalized 2x with nothing by mouth for a week along with a course of Cipro prior to deciding on elective surgery. The threat of an emergency colostomy and a second surgery to ""hook""me back up convinced me) The Metamucil worked woders for loose stool but did nothing for the severe urgency and in fact made matters worse as there was now enormous volume several times a day. Here it is 20 plus years latter and still no signs of relief. My faith in surgeons is at zero. Being a take charge guy and not willing to be a shut in, I developed a ""protection"" system that allows me the freedom I expect in life. Believe me, it was far from easy. It took me years to have confidence in myself and the protection I use. But it did happen over time and I now just simply own it. I still enjoy family, friends and activities from golf to kayaking. I'm socially selective but try not to restict myself just because I need to use diapers. I take numerous precautions, including the use of Nullo deoderant pills, a constant skin barrier (Desitin-zinc oxide), and confi dry 24/7 disposables as a ""diaper liner"" under a cloth pull-up diaper from Kins. Covered by some heavy gage plastic pants and with the Nullo, odor becomes a non-issue.  This keeps stool off my cloth diaper, increases capacity and prevents leaks. I use some athletic compresion shorts when out in public and have never had a comment or anyone notice (to my knowledge, not that it would matter.)  I dress casually with appropriate loose clothing and while I don't advertise my condition, I don't hide it either. I own it. This comfort level took years to achieve and there was a lot of trial and error. I retired early (at 56) and refused to let this rule my life like it did for at least 5 years. It's funny becuase when away from home for hours (library, family gatherings, sporting events etc.) friends will ask if I'm ""ok"" meaning do I need to attend to a wet or messy diaper. With my level of protection I can go all day with urine (up to 10 hours) and BM's ( my protection can hold several large BM's as the dry 24/7 provide superior containment). With the way I wear my protection it's virtually impossible for a public change. I've never had to after the first few years and with the Nullo and plastic pants/compresion shorts along with the Desitin, it just comes down to becoming comfortable with a load in my pants (which I admit took a lot of getting used to). But the hassel of a public change became so traumatic the adjustment was easy to make. With the bulk producing fiber supplement I can count on one hand over 20 years that loose stool events that put an end to whatever I happened to be doing. Don't get me wrong. It has been a very frustrating and yse, at times depressing situation to deal with. But when it became apparent that the problem was not going away I simply had to do something that would return me to at least a sembalance of normalcy. I'm not a super strong person but I am pragmatic and my way of dealing with this potentially limiting affliction was to develope a system and routine that allows me to be a part of the human race. I read these other stories and it makes me want to cry. So many surrendering and withdrawing. I am well aware that constant loose stool is an almost insurmountable complication, There are still ways to prepare. It is so very imortant that one stops fearing what others think. Especially those close to you. They have been my inspiration to forge ahead and join them in living a full life. I apologize for running past the 500 word limit but I felt what I had to say should be shared so that others could see that a full life is possible. The inconvenience of having to change a diaper, often several times a day, is in fact a MAJOR inconvenience. But if that is the hand youv'e been delt, I suggest finding a way that works for you to return to as normal a life as possible. And thank God for understanding friends, family and spouses.",,shorts,toilet,activity,friend,family,plastic,short,system,surgery,sporting event
641,"It was under advice, good direction, and being to the end of my rope that I am finally telling my story, or at least the side no one knows of...  May of 2012, I was hit by a drunk driver on my way to work. It was a horrific crash that left me severely injured, including 9 broken bones and a very serious brain injury that required 6 surgeries and a medically induced coma to even have the slightest chance to survive.  It was the longest waiting game for my mother, who sat there day after day by my bed not knowing if I was going to survive and if I did survive, preparing herself to take care of her vegetative 24 year old son.  Sept 2012, I was eased out of the coma and a few days later showed signs of waking. What my mother witnessed when I did was devastating. Her 24 year old son, and only child, in an infant-like state. I could not speak, understand, sit up, eat, walk, roll over, toilet, etc. You name it, I lost the ability/control.  Fast forward five years to how I am today... I have far surpassed every prognosis and prediction doctors have made and I continue going to PT, OT, and ST 3-4 times a week to continue my recovery. I have regained my speech, hand/eye coordination, I can feed myself, change my clothes, pretty much all functions except my mobility is still somewhat poor and I certainly can not walk the way I use to. I'm very unsteady and require a walker and leg braces.  While that has been frustrating gaining my mobility back, I have had very little progress over the years regaining my bowel and bladder control, even through specific training and treatments. At home, I have been able to manage things a bit better, but I still have accidents because 60% I have no sensation with either bladder or bowels and simply can't control having the accident.  Within the past few months, I have been looking at incontinence product options with the goal to get away from the diapers and possibly be able to wear the pull ups or even the washable incontinence briefs. I decided to give both a try and the pull ups worked well for being at home, but if I was having to go to therapy, I needed to wear a diaper because of the increase in bowel accidents I have when exercising.  A few weeks ago I was having one of my days where I just felt beat up, defeated, ashamed, embarrassed... My mother has unfailingly cared for my every need since my car wreck and I hate to admit that even still to this day, my mother sometimes has to help me change, especially if I've had a soiling accident. This day also decided to teach me a lesson about knowing what you can and can't do, regardless of what you want. I decided that I was at the end of my rope with having accidents and decided that maybe if I wore my washable incontinence briefs it would make pay a bit more attention to my body and possibly get to the restroom quicker. It was time for my mom to take me to PT, so she grabbed my change bag, helped me up and to the car, and we headed on our way.  We get there, go in, and as always, my mother was there every step of the session, cheering me on. I was doing set of standing exercises and transitioned to my sit-ups. I was laying on my back on the PT table. My PT, his assistant (who've I've had a crush on for years now) and my mother. Amanda, the assistant, was helping me do my exercises when all of a sudden, without warning or sensation, I began having a bowel movement... And of course with that came a sizable wetting accident... All into a brief that wasn't made to hold very much urine, and no bowel movement at all. I froze. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. Amanda very quickly asked if I was okay. I very quickly and frantically responded no, all while still soiling my briefs. I kept trying to stop but my pants filled up more now up the front. I laid there, still petrified and completely humiliated. Amanda leaned down and very quietly whispered in my ear asking me if I had just had an accident. I nodded very quickly. She alerted my mother, they both helped my get up and took me into the bathroom. Amanda offered to help my mother, but my mother politely declined. Words can not express my embarrassment. I just soiled and wet all over myself not only in public, but in front of Amanda.  Accepting these issues has been the hardest thing to do. Swallowing my pride and forgetting all about privacy at 29 when your mother has to change you. It has become a misery and very private aspect to my life. I do not date, I do not go out with friends, I do not leave home unless necessary for therapy.  Amanda has come over a few times to try to get me out of the house but I have refused every time and have been completely honest with her as to why... Essentially, fear of public humiliation if my brief leaks in any way.  This is not what I like to call quality of life, but unfortunately it is what it is. Avoiding accidents is obviously impossible, but most days I'm just glad that my diaper has kept the soiling/wetting accident contained.  Hopefully sharing my story can help you all feel just a bit better.",,mother,accident,quality of life,home,toilet,tale,assistant,exercise,car,therapy
642,"I wanted to tell my story of gastroparesis to try and help other people that are going through it. I had idiopathic gastroparesis, which means the cause was unknown, but the doctors believed it was caused by some damage to the vagus nerve. At the time I was in fifth grade, so 10 or 11 years old when I was diagnosed with gp (gastroparesis,) but I had it for many months before that. The process up to the disgnostic was long, tiring, and frustrating. I hated feeling nauseous, and since eating and drinking made me nauseous, I cut out food and fluids almost compltely, so multiple doctors just diagnosed me as dehydrated and sent me on my way with IVs and that was it. Luckily, one doctor was able to perform an endoscopy and tested my digestion with radioactive eggs and diagnose me. He told me it would take about 14-16 hours to digest the eggs, when it takes a normal person 6-8 hours. When we found out it was gp, I was estatic to know what it was finally, but was scared because there was no cure and no matter the medication I took I still felt nauseous. Then came the depression and mental struggles. This was 75% of the battle with gp. I felt like there was no end, no light at the end of the tunnel, and thought I would have this for the rest of my life. I didn't see the hope, I was only staying the same and wasn't getting any better. However, I decided finally that it was about time I stopped wallowing in my sorrows and try to get better. On a good day, I wrote a note to myself, saying how strong I was, how supporting my family was, and that there would be an end to the madness. Then whenever I had a bad day, I read that message and it made me feel so much better. I also kept a journal about how I felt, mostly the bad feelings, so I could get them out of my head instead of keeping them welled up inside. I pushed myself to eat and drink, although my brain told me it was wrong, and got better. I had gp for a little longer than a year and a half, then the symptoms almost seemed to disappear. Gp to me was a big test to show myself how strong I was, and I think it teaches us all that. We don't think of our motility often or at all, but as soon as it starts effecting our lives, we realize how important it is. I want to tell everyone going through it that you are not alone, there's always someone out there willing to help, this won't ruin your life, and most importantly, you have to be strong. Gp won't go away unless you persevere and stand up to it and show it that you're stronger than it. I hope this helped!",,doctor,doctor,egg,depression,start,exam,brain,head,head,magazine
643,"I am one of only 1/100,000 people to get to have achalasia (0.001% of the population).  Thinking back, my story really started in my 20's.  At the age of 23 when I was pregnant, I remember having an ""air bubble"" lodged in my upper stomach/lower esophagus.  I would beat my back against wall trying to get it up.  This was just a tiny nuissance and didn't really bother me much.  Flash forward 16 years and I started having severe pain.  I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with reflux and given Prevacid.  Well, come to find out Prevacid and most other OTC refulx meds have a sulfoxyl group and I am allergic.  Therefore I could not take any of that.  Since it wasn't that bad and was infrequent, I just worked around it.  The pain started getting worse and I would go to the ER for a GI cocktail - I worked at the hospital and could be seen as an outpatient, be given the meds and go back to work or home.  Again, this was infrequent and I could manage it.  Last year, at the age of 44, I moved to another city and decided to try again to get more answers.  I saw a gastro doc and explained everything.  He did and endoscopy and stretched my esophagus, which helped.  Biopsies were normal.  After going back again with the same pain and graphic descriptions of the pain, he sent me for the most awful test in the world, a manometry.  It revealed I have achalasie level II or something of the sort.  My records say that this is most treatable.  I chose to have Botox and I was able to make it work for about 10 months.  I saw a surgeon and she prescribed Procardia - it actually helps.  I have esophageal spasms, too.  In the middle of the night, my food or water will make a second appearance and I wake up coughing and choking.  I have had enough of that and have decided to have the Heller myotomy.  At this point, most days I am unable to swallow even water and I can regurgitate anything very easily as most of the time it is still stuck in the esophagus.

My friends mom had just gone through her first surgery for removing 70% of her esophagus from cancer and recommended I sought a professional but I put it off.

I saw 3 general doctors who ended up telling me I had to see a gastro specialist. The specialist told me my severity of what they see in 40-50 year olds. I had an upper endoscopy done which showed signs of extreme scaring and sores. I was placed on pantoprazol and have been on this for 2 years going on my 3rd year taking the highest dosage prescribed.

After all the lab tests done, an ER visit, an upper endoscopy and X-ray, they have concluded I have gastroparesis. i see a lot of people saying to remain hopeful, but honestly this has already taken away many aspects of my life, its extremely difficult to have even a glimmer of hope. I had to take a leave off work, I never take my dog out, I hardly leave the house, I have to take 4 different medicines each day just to be able to function half way. Can anyone tell me it gets better? I guess I'm just terrified that this is going to be my life forever and I'll have to quit my job and stay at home for the rest of my days. I'm very scared, everyone. i love my life and I wish to have it back. Please offer some hope.",,home,job,pound sterling,pound,medicine,tale,drug,dog,people,endoscopy
647,"I was diagnosed with gastroparesis and severe GERD about a year ago now. For a year and a half I went undiagnosed. I couldn't get anything down my throat and was losing weight fast. I was 40 kgs and depressed at life. I didn't want people to see what i looked like, and everyone that did thought i was anerexic. It was a very horrible time in my life.  Every day I would have cramps in my stomach and the slightest smell of food would make me feel nausea. My throat would tense up, restricting any food from getting down. Each meal would be two, three bites max and i would be full.  I'm now on three different types of medicatiojn but still experience my good days and bad. Sometimes it's good months and bad months... i just never know how i will feel.  This disease has has such a great affect on my physical health but more than anything it has affected me mentally. I was never the loud on but i loved hanging with my firends and going out. Now i suffer from extreme anxiety. I lack self-confidence and avoid every situation that shows my body.  To say i'm still learning the ropes of this sickness is an understatement. I'm not sure i will ever know everything about it.

648,"Hi! This is partly my story, but really my son's story. See my 2 year old has gastroparesis, a redundant colon, reflux and a dairy intolerance. Gosh, i feel like a GI specialist now!  I don't know where to start and I really don't know how to keep it to 500 words.  It's been a long journey the past two years. We have been to every urgent care and ER in the city. I don't think I've slept in two years either.  But, I don't want to talk about that. It's our history now. He is 2 and he is fine. I tell myself this at least three or four times a day.  He is fine.  He is chronic now, so my hope of it going away isn't possible. But, we have a great doctor (this is key) and it is managed. He takes medication 9 times a day and that's not counting the medicine for his asthma or iron deficiency (fun little by-products of everything else).  He is fine.  If I say it enough it will be true. But in all honesty he is. His growth is normal, hovers around the 30th percentile mark for both height and weight. He started daycare a few weeks ago and he loves it. No one would know if we didn't tell them. He hits al of his milestones. The doctors say he defies all odds. I say he is stronger than anyone knows. He is full of life and such an amazing person to be around.  In my darkest hour--when I don't think things will be fine--I imagine him being 25 and living in NY (because he's a model of course). I call him to find out if he has pooped for the day and he gets made at me for asking. I laugh at this and come back to reality. And I'm able to carry on.  I hate this disease. It's silent and it's debilitating.

649,"I could really use some support.  I am a 54 yr old mother, grandma & wife.  I was diagnosed with IBS (but not treated with meds) about 30 years ago & fibromyalgia about 14 years ago.  About 5-1/2 years ago I suddenly got really sick to my stomach and, with no warning.  I was fine when I woke up, then suddenly started throwing up uncontrollably, noisily (which I'd never been), and violently.  I ended up in the hospital overnight.  They couldn't say what caused it.  Six months later I got these white polka dots on my feet and hands.  24 hours later I git sick again.  This time I was hospitalized for 4 days.  A colonoscopy found a few polyps that were removed.  I was told I probably got this from the grandchildren.  The doc said, ""you know the anti-bacterial that says it kills 99.9% of germs?  You have the .1%."". 6 Months later I woke up fine, then an hour later started vomiting again.  This last description is what has been happening for 5-1/2 years, every six months, up until this year.  I went in around the usual 6 month timeframe, thought I had six more months to keep trying to find answers, but got sick again a month later.  That was June & July this year.  It happened again last Friday.  I was released Saturday after 5:00 pm.  I have all new docs.  I've had a brain cat scan, a gastric emptying study, an abdominal ultrasound and countless blood/stool/urine tests and no answers yet.  I still have a small bowel follow through this week and a follow up colonoscopy next week.  The only out of the ordinary thing found was some nodules on my thyroid.  All thyroid tests are normal.  This is so hard on me & my family.  I am desperate for even a suggestion of a direction to move in to find out how to stop this.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",,bacterial,family,exam,blood,gastric,scan,cat,brain,germ,mother

She has NF1 (Neurofibromatosis Type 1), and Plexiform Neurofibromas were recently discovered in 2 sections of her small intestines. They have invaded her intestinal walls. This has affected function and has resulted in malabsorption and iron deficient anemia. We have a Hematologist, Neurologist and Gastroenterologist. We are very happy with them. However, the precise location of the Neorfibromas is so rare that they have not seen it before, and have not been able to locate colleagues who have seen it. We saw an intestinal surgeon this week but the first thing he said was that he knows nothing about NF.

651,"Hello, I am an 18 year old female who has been experiencing gastrointestinal disorder like sysmptoms for almost a year now, and am still on my journey to finding both answers and solutions.  Throughout the beginning of 2016, I experienced waves of overwhelming nausea, a dull achy pain in the pit of my stomach and an extreme dislike for food once or twice a month, lasting usually for a day or two. Not thinking much of it, and being told it was simply heartburn, I never seen a doctor.  Nearing the end of August, as my first year of university was approaching, my symptoms started to worsen, I'm assuming because of stress. Since then, every morning I wake up around 4:30 (about half an hour before my alarm) with a pretty moderate uneasy and dull achy feeling just below my sternum in my upper abdomen. Along with it comes extreme nausea and throwing up of a clear, yet frothy and bubbly mucusy mess. Although there is not much throw up, the uncomfort before and during the episodes are accompanied by dry heaving and coughing, causing mucus to collect in my mouth resulting in lots of spitting.  I have been seeing doctors since the beginning of September, have had two blood and urine tests, a urea breath test to check for h. pylori, a complete ultrasound of my abdomen and have been on Pantaloc. All of my tests have come back negative, which is both relieving and frustraing, and after a month on the Pantaloc I have seen little to no improvements on my symptoms.  My story here is to hopefully find some answers from fellow sufferers and possible solutions or remedies to help cope with this. Not knowing exactly what is causing this pain, and having to deal with it every morning with no answers is extremely frustrating and depressing. I can no longer eat the foods I love, like chocolate, spicy foods and fruits because they worsen my morning symptoms and I feel like my symptoms control my life and my happiness.  I have had much trouble eating and being optimistic and happy about life because I feel so hopeless and helpless sometimes. My mornings are always dreaded and involved intense and desperate cries for relief and answers before leaving for school. I just need answers, a solution, a friend who understands, or a deep deep hole to suffer in away from outside responsibility and human interaction.",,food,exam,nausea,pain,doctor,doctor,mouth,hole,hole,friend
652,"I am 13 years old and i have been dealing with severe, chronic constipation my entire life. My constipation was pretty bad when I was younger, considering I was young and didn't really know what was going on with me. By the time I was 10 or 11 years old, my constipation seemed to being gettting better, or at least I thought. In March of 2016, my 7th grade year, I started experiencing nausea. It came suddenly. That first day it all started I just thought I ate too much.  My nausea was pretty bad that day. I remember having to get up in the middle of class feeling like I had to throw up. I went to the bathroom and didnt throw up. I felt very nauseous and uncomfortable in class, so I went home. The next time I was nauseous, my mom gave me cyproheptadine. This worked great.  It lasted 24 hours and I wasn't nauseous at all. i was nauseous a few more times, but by the 4th or 5th time taking cyproheptadine, it wasn't as effective. After, coming back from spring break April 4, is when my nauseous became daily. I was constantly asking to go to the nurse because of how sick I felt. I alwasy asked to go to the bathroom thinking I was gonna puke. I would go in home in the middle of the school day becaus eo how miserbale I flelt, but when I got home I felt okay.  I went to my peditrician and he did some blood work. My blood tests came back and I had high sugar and cholestrol. So my mom and I thought my nausea was because of this. I started drinking less soda and eating more fruit. I was still nauseous however, but I never threw up, always feeling like I had to.  It took about a month to get an approval from the insurance to refer me to a Gastrologist. So, i took cyproheptadine all month and my nausea was sometimes bareable.  In May, the Gastrologist put me on erythromycin. I took it for about a week and it made me feel worse. I tried Zofran a few times, but it didn't make me feel 100 percent better. So, a few days later he prescribed me Metoclopram. This really seemed to work. I took it twice a day along with cyproheptadine once a day. However, in May there were a few times I had lots of nausea but no vomitting. The end of the school year comes by and I am still not 100 percent better. I start taking metoclopram three times. My GI doctor, requested a CT scan. And my the end of June, I had the CT scan.  A few days I got the results and my doctor said he saw what he thought was endometrium growing outside my uterus. So a few weeks later, I saw an OBGYN. I got an ultrasound and she found nothing. *what a waste of time* By this time summer was almost over. School comes along, and I start getting stomach cramps and heartburn. So my GI doctor prescribes me a medication that treats ulcers/ acid reflux ( at this point I was desperate and sure it was acid reflux) . I took the medication two times a day along with metoclopram twice a day. However, the metoclopram began making me feel very depressed, constipated even more, and I had increased hunger and apetite. But, i still took it all of August because it helped my nausea most.  On Septmeber 1, I got an endonoscopy, expecting my doctor to say I had acid reflux. I was surprised when he said I had Bile Reflux Gastritis. That day was probably the best day of my life because for months I didn't know what was wrong with me. I had many breakdowns where I just cried and cried because of how much this nausea had affected my life. I lost interest in things I used to love doing, which was absolutely heartbreaking. I ended 7th grade nauseous and depressed. I started 8th grade nausoues and depressed. My doctor put me on Amoxicillin which I had to take 3 times a day on a full stomach. I also took Cholestyramine twice day, along with laxatives. I was completley done with metoclopram. My nausea began to subdue.  However, I am unsure if it did anything. It was supposed to help push the bowel out of my system. It gave me really bad stomach cramps, but that just meant it was working.  My body is so used to not having a bowel movement for several days at a time that it just refuses to go every single day. Its now October, and I still have stomach cramps often. Every single morning, I wake up very nauseous and with stomach cramps, by afternoon it stops, but by evening it comes back, and at night it is really bad. Throughout these several months I felt very very very very hopeless. I felt ver sad now knwoing what was wrong with me for so long. And now that I do im frustrated because its techincally not curable and some people thought my sickness was invlaid because I had never thrown uo once. One time, I went to the ER becaouse of how nauseous I felt. That feeling 2 minutes you feel before you throw up is what i felt for about 12 hours. i got no sleep that night. And it is very rare for bile reflux gasritis to occur through constipation. But because I have had chronic consitpation my entire life, bile reflux starts to come along.  I feel very lonely because I know of no one my age going thorugh this. I feel alone because I feel everyone around me is healthy and I am not. Because of my illness I have become a different person. I have become less fun, less motivated, less me.  I am posting my story in hopes of finding someone else who is going throughwhat I am. I hope to find teenagers who are in constant pain and discomfort like I am . I shouldnt have to worry about this I'm only 13, minding you it all started when I was 12.

653,"Hi everyone, my name is Jorge and I currently live in north Georgia. About a week ago during one of my frustrations, I stumbled upon this website. And I am just astonished at the story's and even though I know that GI problems are very occurrent in a lot of people's lives, reading these story's I can see very vivid images of what al of you are going through. The reason that I ended up here is because I have had GI problems since I was 10. I am currently 19 and am a college student.  When I was 10 I found out that I had a rectum prolapse, and the way I found out was by showing my mom and dad because i thought it was normal for some odd reason. Since then I have had 4 rectum prolapse surgery because the first 3 failed and gave me more and more problems. Thankfully the last surgery was the one. But where I am still struggling is that after my 3rd surgery I have had very bad constipation, bloating, vomiting, cramps, fever, and body debilitation.  So currently I am taking stimulant laxatives every 4th day and as all of you may be living through the exact same thing, some stimulant laxatives cause a lot of cramping, dehydration, nausea, and bloating due to the retention of water. And for most of you wondering I have tried almost every natural supplement, over the counter, and prescription drug and dulcolax is the only thing that helps me. I've also tried diets, gluten free, low fodmap diet, exercise, heavy exercise, and nothing works.  And also after my last surgery I have really bad pains in my stomach and lower body area due to the incisions and nerves. So all of this kind of frustrates me but I try to hold my head up high knowing that I don't have a feeding tube, knowing that I don't have a colostomy bag (in which doctors insist that this is my only option) and that I can also eat. There are always people going through worse so I try to make the best of myself each day. I am currently trying to go to mayo clinic since it seems like the place to be for my history. All I want is a doctor who is not arrogant and who can sympathize with me and my issues. Wether he or she can help me or not it is very heartwarming when a doctor does whatever they can. Thank you to all the people who are writing these story's to help us cope and to give us hope that we will get better and also to do the most with what holds us back.",,surgery,tale,people,doctor,doctor,body,stimulant,kind,exercise,kind
654,"God bless you for this site.Sharing with ppl who UNDERSTAND helps! @62, I was dx with very invasive breast cancer.Since I had such fierce cancer, I was given LOTS of VERY strong chemo. One is KNOWN to ruin heart function.But the one that brought me here was one made of bark of a literally poisonous tree.THAT one, poisonous in toto, caused the oncologists to give out Imodium like M&Ms in the chemo room. After 6 months of hard chemo, I was given a colonoscopy(!!!) although I was BARELY well enough not to live on the toilet.I begged the doc, but he said their usual thing:""You'll be fine.""I WASNT. I had mucho diarrhea , and took Imodium daily. GRADUALLY it turned to IBS. I'd get diarrhea if I got nervous..And it was liveable-with.That was 13 years ago. I learned that making plans stressed me so that if I went out to dinner, there were bound to be bathroom visits-before, afterwards..I made less dinner engagements.. About 12 years ago, I started having bad edema& heart trouble.The drugs they gave me-you guessed it-made my IBS worse.They also made the arthritis in my knees awful.I'm a potter, I had to sell my house & get an apartment because my clay studio was in the basement. (Plus the bathrooms were on the 2 and 3 floor..) NOT a good set up for occasional diarrhea. Plus I had no income but my SS. Things got worse. I had to move to a senior housing project. Worse things got, more upset gut. For some reason, the bathroom is VERY far from the bedroom here. My IBS grew worse until one day 2 months ago, I woke up and actually felt peristalisis taking place.(cant run) but made it to bathroom only to lose it when I bent over to take off panties.Only familiar w/accidents by babies and puppies, I was horrified @ the HUGE mess a liquidy stool makes. It takes LONG to clean up. Floor, wall, toilet, clothes.Crying time.Today it happened again.And yes, as others have said, it is turning me into a hermit.Not constant(yet?) but never predictable.Plus there is leakage from an old hemmorhoid, which has taken to wetting the back of my pants.So right-no whites in summer, no light-colored clothing.Leaking is mucous, but on IBS days, there is a bit of stool involved. There is someone on my floor who uses adult diapers.(Trash room is how I know)A very nice woman friend has what looks like a coloscopy bag under her shirt.These things are NEVER mentioned.Which is why I'm here, telling my tale. Thank you for sharing, and thank you, iffgd for this VERY helpful site.

655,"I just put IBS because that's what I think I have, i'm not actually sure what I have at the moment. I am a 19 year old girl, I've had diarrhea daily, sometimes multiple times in a day, for about 2 months straight, everyday. At first, for about a year or so, I had stomach issues, where i'd get gas regularly, I had bowel issues, my stomach would rumble loudly when I held gas in, and holding gas in made me feel relly really bad ill bad horrible. I'd get lots of headaches, tiredness, feeling weak, down, dehydrated, hungry, lots of stomach pains.  More recently, for about a month I had on and off diarrhea, at first I had a bad reaction to Vitamin tablets, because i'm a very fussy eater, I decided to take vitamins and had a bad bad bad reaction for about 5 days. But then the diarrhea came back on and off for I don't know what reason, but for the past 2 months its just been completly on and its horrible. It literally takes over my life, I felt terrible after a bit of weetabix this morning, I couldn't even eat it all because eating it was making me feel sick, I felt horrible for the whole of my lecture like so ill but I really don't want this to take over my life because I don't want to be missing uni because of this.  For years, when I was younger, I consumed a lot of caffeine from when I was 14 till about 3 or 4 months ago, I guess you could say its weird but I had a weird addiction to Diet Coke where it got to the point where i'd get stressed out and search for money if I couldn't afford to buy it, and I kept them in my room consuming between 8 and 12 cans of Diet Coke a day, weird, I know, but I originally thought for the past year that's what was causing all of my symtoms and if I just stopped I would feel better again, but no, i've got much worse, I stopped drinking excessively about 3 or 4 months ago, and obviously i'm still very ill, more ill in fact, i'm aware that could still be a cause, but I also tried to improve my diet as I am such a fussy eater, i've tried cutting down on caffeine and drinking more water but i'm sill so ill.  I went to see the doctor for the first time around 6 or 7 weeks ago, i've had blood tests they took a stool sample everything came back normal a part from my white blood cells being low, I now have to have retest for my blood tests and do the stool sample again, its been so long and I just want to find out what's wrong with me so bad! I've been on the imodium recently for a few weeks on and off, the doctor said to take two a day, it slowed things down for me slightly but even the second or third day of taking them I felt bad again. I've stopped taking them now cos I ran out and don't want to waste my money, and i've felt horrible these past few days.  Food just goes straight through me, I eat a meal and my stomach feels bad immediatly, its horrible, especially when I have a life i'd like to be living, because food doesn't stay inside me it makes me so hungry, like really hungry, but I never over-eat because I get hungry so often, I have lost weight over the past year/year and a half or so without trying, I also get tired and dehydrated because nothing stays inside my body. I have had blood in my stool just twice. I think I have IBS, probably caused by too much caffeine, but I do have the symtoms for everything else which is similar symtoms, but i'm pretty sure I don't have them, I would however prefer to be gluten free because as annoying as that seems at least its easy to manage my symtoms because i'm so young I really don't want to be ill forever! I tried to check myself to see if I was lactose intollerant, and I felt ill so don't think I am. I'm probably gonna test for gluten free next because the doctors are taking forever and i'm sick and tired of waiting to know what's wrong, and the thought of having this forever makes me really sad and annoyed. It just leads to a really awkward life, especially when I didn't tell people for so long because I was embarressed. I don't want to take time off uni or work or a social life because i'm feeling ill or because I have a doctors appointment its just really unfair, and i'm feeling really really ill right now. I just live on the internet googling stuff because I don't know what's wrong with me yet, and I felt like I had to let it all out because as understanding as everyone in my life tries to be, they don't really understand.",,doctor,stomach,doctor,gas,blood,exam,food,vitamin,social life,people
656,"I was a young, fun, athletic 37 year old, relatively healthy, living in the heart of Chicago, with an amazing job and awesome social network, when my weight started to suddenly plummet...and rapidly. Test after test, revealed nothing except a clinically deficiently low level of vitamin B12. The lab variances ranged from 211 to 947. I was at 75 and having symptoms of neuropathy.  My weight kept dropping drastically. I went from 114 lbs to a frail 97 lbs. I am 5'5 and petite framed to begin with so I couldn't afford to spare an ounce (literally ir figuratively). I couldn't eat or digest anything solid. Oatmeal, soup broth, apple sauce, and Gatorade became my best friends. One meal in the morning was filling and sufficient enough for the entire day. My caloric intake was really low and I was feeling malnourished. Not to mention, the severe nausea and bloating that accompanied it was awful. My loved ones were concerned and I agreed to even see a therapist and nutritionist. Maybe it was my imagination? Maybe it was stress and my poor diet? (I am a self admittedly junk food junkie). Afterall, thousands of dollars in repeated medical tests such as colonoscopies and endoscopies, were inconclusive or within normal limits. I finally moved back home to a warmer climate and to seek the best health care possible. My awesome and highly skilled GI doctor ran a battery of tests from Crohn's and Celiacs to Pernicious Anemia and everything else in between. It all balanced out like a perfect check book. Negative for all three. Sigh of relief...but still determined to figure out the culprit. He finally suggested a unique and costly test called a Gastric Emptying Scan. Finally, it revealed the culprit and I was diagnosed with moderate Gastroparesis with less than 90% of retention after 4 hours. I was so relieved and became obsessed with learning more about my condition, how to cope with it, and how to help others. Since I am not Diabetic, I was classified as Idiopathic (unknown). I started a treatment by taking Reglan, but it was too agressive for my stomachs lining. So, my doctor put me on a different regiment and prescribed Domperidone (sounded like a fancy champagne to all my non medical friends). However, the problem is that Domperidone was not widely known nor was it FDA approved in the United States so I had to order it from a Canadian pharmacy, and sometimes, would wait months for the shipment to arrive. I am glad to report that I corrected my diet (eliminated fats and fibers) and have gained some weight back, but I still have a little ways to go until I reach my optimal weight. I am feeling healthy, and fortunately, only have flare ups every three or four months. I actively started playing tennis again regularly and gained some energy back. Sharing my story with you has been therapeutic and has allowed me to combine my passion/hobby of writing and fascination with medicine into one story line. Although GP is not curable, it is manageable and treatable. I am optimistic that one day we will find a cure and I want to be a part of it.  PS-I am not sure if my original diagnosis, a B12 deficiency, had any correlation to the GP diagnosis, but my personal advice is to get your B12 checked (especially if you're a vegetarian).",,weight,weight,exam,B12,diagnosis,culprit,doctor,doctor,medical,diet

659,"7 years ago I had surgery to fix a hiatus hernia. Straight away I was unwell and within 3 months I went back to the surgeon complaining of problems with my bowel. I was told it was because I was still recovering from my operation. the next 5 years were the worst years of my life. I was always sick either vomiting or being on the toilet up to 20 times a day, for days at a time with an overactive bowel. I was given so many diagnosis and given so many different diets to try I was even treated like I was a hypochondriac. I had tried to tell several drs I didnt think my stomach worked. I gained lots of weight my face was always swollen and my stomach was always distended. One day I started burping disgusting burps. It was so embarrasing I didnt want to be around people. I finally begged a dr to test if my stomach was working. The next week my world changed forever I was told I had gastroparesis with zero motility. The Dr said my vegus nerve had been cut when I had my hernia op. My condition got so bad that after losing 30kgs I had to have a PEJ inserted to bypass my stomach straight into my intestine. I am now hooked up to a machine 9 hrs a day to get nurtrician. I can no longer sleep lying down incase I aspirate. I can only have 1 coffee or a few iceblocks in a day nothing else or I end up in hospital. I will never be able to eat food again. The damage is spreading to my bowel and I have to take laxatives daily to help my bowel to work. I spend weeks at a time in hospital, I can no longer swim, im in pain a lot I take lots of medication and I am losing my hair. My consultant at the hospital says he doesnt know how this will progress as hes never come across damage to the vagus nerve due to surgery. I wish I had known about this condition years before so I could have learnt more about it as it progressed. 18 months on, I am now running a charity to feed people in the community who are struggling. I wake up each day and remind myself im lucky im alive and the feeding tube is just part of my life now. I try to fit as much into every day as I can before I have to hook up to the machine again. It can sometimes be 20 hours a day. I have a backpack to put my portable machine in and I am always looking forward to the day that medical science is able to fix me. I am not confident enough to travel yet but im hopeing I might be able to vist my son in Australia next year. Its best to find out as much as you possibly can about this condition and learn to live with it the best way that you can. I dont think my condition can be fixed but you should research every option possible for you to make your life more enjoyable",,condition,stomach,surgery,damage,doctor,doctor,people,hiatus hernia,charity,adviser
660,"My five year old son Weston has struggled with gastrointestinal symptoms since he was born in 2010. These symptoms began as vomiting, diarrhea, failure to thrive, malabsorption syndrome, and acid reflux . The doctors first suggested that we eliminate certain foods in my diet because I was strictly breastfeeding. There were very few symptom changes with my food eliminations. The doctors then suggested we supplement his diet by adding formula. We tried multiple formulas with little to no success as my sons symptoms all still continued even with the multiple formula changes. The doctors then suggested I quit breastfeeding all together and try a medically made formula called Neocate. Neocate is an amino acid based formula which makes it easier for infants to digest and process through their digestive system. The Neocate worked somewhat, my little one, at five weeks of age finally started gaining weight and was no longer failure to thrive. Some of the other symptoms diminished slightly but then he was struggling with constipation in addition to the other symptoms that were still present. My son was put on Miralax at about 10 months. The Miralax was helpful to some degree but after years of taking the medication it eventually stopped working. He was also given medicines early on for acid reflux but those medications did not seem to help at all so we discontinued using them. Over the last five years my son has been under the care of multiple different gastroenterologists at multiple different hospitals none of which really knew anything about Functional Gastrointestinal and Motility Disorders. In September of 2014 we finally got Weston's first of many tummy xrays. After that he was hospitalized multiple times for clean outs and dysimpactions and has had multiple tests and procedures. My son has been a patient at the Colorectal Clinic at C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital at University of Michigan for over a year. He has been diagnosed with multiple different things such as; chronic constipation, encopresis, slow colonic transit, colonic dysmotility, functional bowel disorder, and so on. We had never even heard of a Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder let alone a motility disorder before my son was a patient at C.S. Mott. He is currently taking daily six medications (5) oral and (1) rectal to keep him having bowel movements and to keep him from becoming impacted with stool. We have tried multiple alternative therapies for symptom relief for him such as; physical therapy, biofeedback therapy, muscle stimulation, even the Sacral Nerve Stimulator Implant, Aromatherapy, and more.  To help raise awareness we have created a Facebook group called Weston's World: https://www.facebook.com/groups/545456308959231/ . Unfortunately, my son has outpaced the doctors at C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital and there is no further testing that can be done there. His doctors now feel it is time to refer him to another specialist. At least this time we will be going to a doctor whose primary focus is FGIMDs. His doctors at C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital are currently in the process of referring him to the Pediatric Motility Center at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Which we have heard amazing things about!

662,"I have post infections ibs (diarrhea) since 2004. My pain and symptoms improve on 2006 due to amitriptyline (50mg a day), a tricyclic antidepressant. My conditions get worse about a year ago. I think amitriptyline was not working anymore. My doctor prescribed antibiotic to reduce gas problems and it work, but I still had to get to the bathroom a lot. Depression, which I also had, got worse as well. Worried about something else different from ibs I get a colonoscopy, which my doctor recommends. I get ride off three polyps and discover some diverticulums. But my ibs symptoms continue out of control. And my doctor was not interested in find some solution to ease my symptoms. I change to mirtazapine for four months trying to reduce depression but didn’t work. It even get worse. Coffee start triggering bowel pain.    Recently I get infectious gastroenteritis from eating raw fish. I get well with antibiotics, but my ibs get worse than ever. I had to get to the bathroom 5 to 6 times a day, and suffer a lot of pain from about three hours two times a week. I felt helpless.  Three weeks ago I changed to amitriptyline again. A week later I found a study which shows vitamin D deficiency in 80% of ibs patients. I thought that was a very high and significant number. But the study didn’t show if deficiency was an ibs consequence or was it the cause. Patients in the study didn’t improve significantly with vitamin D supplementation either. Additional studies were appointed. Anyway I decided to get vitamin d supplementation: 400 UI a day from monday to friday and get 30-40 minutes of sun exposure (saturday and sunday) - even thought 10 to 15 minutes were suggested. Vitamin D production in the body starts with direct sun light on the skin, no glass window between. Light skin color produce more easily vitamin D under the sun, compare to dark skin. But at the same time light skin is more vulnerable to sking cells damage (cancer).    After a week of vitamin doses and two weeks after amitriptyline intake, my symptoms improve drastically. I even get worried when I didn’t go to the bathroom in a whole day. But there was nothing to worried about. My depression got reduced as well significantly. Recently I ate fatty meat and some wine in a restaurant and my bowel didn’t move at all. Another day I feel confident enough to drink coffee and still my bowel didn’t move. Now I go to the bathroom one and some times two times a day without urgency. My improvement could be only thanks to amitriptyline. But I still will be taking vitamin d supplements and sunbaths. Hope this improvement lasts.",,vitamin,skin,toilet,sun,doctor,doctor,pain,depression,depression,worried
663,"Thank you to all brave sufferers of faecal incontinence who have shared their story. I am an author - not a very famous one, but a published one - and I am a nurse, as well as a sufferer of FI since giving birth 24 years ago. One day I would like to seek everyone's permission and write stories. I want the world to know what we go  through because why should we feel guilty, dirty and live with a dirty secret?  (I have published one short story by that name, and although anonymous it wasn't an easy story to see on the printed page).  I have decided to have a permanent colostomy and the hospital called me today and it is booked for 2 weeks time. This doesn't give me a lot of time to adjust, but as my husband said, it was a decision I made a long time ago - now it's a matter of going through the process and dealing with a new lifestyle after. I have had two anal sphincter repairs, one temporary colostomy, the sacral nerve stimulator and physio. All to no avail. When the anal area is on fire, I use Panadeine because the codeine kills two problems. I try to avoid the latter for reasons of potential addiction, but when I'm desperate I resort to that.  When I had the temporary colostomy I actually managed quite well. Perhaps being a nurse helped - I had seen many stomas and had helped patients change them over the years, although was by no means an expert. The first few months were tough, but, unless I've conveniently forgotten the difficulties, from memory, once I got used to it my life was so much better that suffering from FI. I'm saying this here because if there is any way you have the option to go down this track please don't disregard exploring it as an option. In fact, as far as 'disabilities' go, I found having a stoma more socially acceptable than IC.  God Bless.",,tale,nurse,lifestyle,God,disability,path,expert,patient,addiction,codeine

666,"How do you tell the story of how your life fell apart? You went to the doctor thinking you just had some weird stomach illness but medicine and the doctor would make it better. In the fall of 2015 I had the worst seasonal allergies I had ever had. It turned into something that felt like a chest cold. I was having trouble breathing, so I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor diagnoses me with bronchitis and gave me a Zpack antibiotic. I began taking the antibiotic and started to notice I was fatigued and loosing my appetite. I finished the antibiotic and continued to feel sick. I began to vomit daily. I went to my primary care doctor who thought I had a stomach virus. I couldn't stop throwing up. I went to the ER, no help. Called and badgered my primary care doctor because I knew this wasn't a normal stomach virus. I had never been so sick. They suggested I go to a GI. I went to the GI and he knew right away what was wrong. GASTROPARESIS. I will never understand how I can be completely healthy and take an antibiotic that people take all the time and end up with severe gastroparesis. It haunts me. What if I had stopped taking the zpack when I first started to feel sick, what if I had just let the bronchitis run its course, what if, what if, what if. I struggle to get through each day. It is daunting. Knowing you will wake up every day for the rest of your life sick and sicker. I was only 36 when this started. So young, so many plans, so much life to live. Now I am just enduring. I pray for more research and hopefully a cure but realistically with the research I have found Ideopathic GP seems to be caused by nerve and cell damage in the stomach. Nerve damage is permanent.

667,"My Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction Story  I went undiagnosed with Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction (SOD) for 14 years…  Immediately after having my gallbladder out in 1998, I developed severe pain in my right side, under my ribs that radiated to my back and shoulder. My primary care and GI doctors ordered an endoscopy, barium enema, and blood tests. All came back normal. My GI doctor told me I had IBS and to drink Metamucil. For the next 12 years I learned to live with the pain. I survived without narcotic pain medication. Instead, I focused on deep breathing, yoga, and a low-fat diet to ease the pain. Over time, the pain became more of an annoyance than a debilitating condition.  Fast forward to September 2, 2011. Three months after having my third son, I became suddenly and severely ill with no appetite, dizziness, brain fog, fatigue, vomiting, and abdominal pain that spread to the area under my sternum. A visit to the ER on September 5, 2011 proved to be uneventful. All of my bloodwork came back normal, as did a stool sample a few days later. The ER initially diagnosed me with clostridium difficile bacterium and viral gastroenteritis. My symptoms did not improve and an endoscopy showed mild gastritis but nothing else. On September 21, 2011, nine days before my 42nd birthday, I was hospitalized for dehydration, vomiting, and abdominal pain coming in at an 8 on a 1 to 10 scale. I was admitted to the hospital for five days and given a healthy dose of iv fluids, narcotic pain, anti-nausea and what I call munchy-inducing medications. I had a CAT scan, which was normal, as was my bloodwork. Prior to being discharged on five or six different medications, the GI doctor who performed the endoscopy told my dad he thought my symptoms were caused by post-partum depression.  My family and I knew otherwise so I sought out a second opinion from another GI group. I thought the GI doctor would be compassionate as it was a woman. She ordered a colonoscopy. When she told me after the colonoscopy that she didn't find anything, I started crying, at which point she told me I probably needed antidepressants and that was my problem. I told her I was on antidepressants and that certainly was not the problem. This led me to a third opinion with a respected, local surgeon. He concluded that it was a strong possibility I had something called Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction (SOD), but first wanted to rule out any vascular issues so off I was to get a CT Angiogram of my abdomen. This came back normal. So, back to the SOD hypothesis. SOD refers to the medical condition that results from the inability of the biliary and/or pancreatic sphincter to contract and relax in a normal fashion. This may cause obstruction of bile flow resulting in biliary pain and obstruction to the flow of pancreatic juice, which can lead to pancreatitis.  The gold standard diagnostic test for SOD was something called an Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with Sphincter of Oddi Manometry, which is an endoscopic procedure used to take x-ray pictures of the ducts (drainage routes) of the gallbladder, liver and pancreas and obtain pressures of the biliary, pancreatic and oddi sphincters. Since my original GI group were the only doctors who performed this in our area, the surgeon called the practice to (strongly) recommend I get this very specialized test. ""Great,"" I thought, ""I will get my diagnosis and get treatment."" Not so fast.  It took another two months to get an appointment with the GI doctor. In the meantime, I was hospitalized for four days right before Christmas for nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and pain. There I had an upper GI series and more bloodwork, which was--you guessed it--normal. Somehow, I was still barely showing up to work and being a mom, while existing (I wouldn't call it living) with the original symptoms. During my GI visit in January, my doctor emphatically told me I didn't need an ERCP (even documented it in my chart) and that my condition, whatever it was, would likely go away on its own. I swear he looked at me like I was crazy. He ordered more bloodwork which was normal again. I cried during and after every doctor visit and procedure. Well, I pretty much cried all the time from feeling so sick and tired and sick and tired of being sick and tired. I knew I wasn't crazy and although I wanted to give up time and again, I knew I had to keep searching for the reason why I was so sick. I continued to have symptoms and was losing weight at a dangerous rate. The surgeon advocated for me to see a different GI doctor from that practice.  The new GI doctor suspected something was going on with my pancreas the way I described my abdominal pain. He tried me on prescription pancreatic enzymes, which, after a week, brought the searing pain under my sternum from a constant 7 out of 10 to a manageable 3 out of 10 (as long as I took them with every meal and snack). Unfortunately my prescription coverage reached its maximum and they were $1,000 a month. Luckily the doctor helped me with samples, but I had to buy them at times when there weren't any samples. My husband and I were going broke from prescriptions and copays. I was becoming skin and bones. The doctor thought I had chronic pancreatitis, so instead of the ERCP, he performed an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) on February 14, 2012, though I wanted an ERCP and to be tested for SOD. The EUS showed a healthy pancreas--another normal test.  Fed up, I searched the Internet for others like me who may have SOD. I found a blog where several women recommended a physician located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Though I live in Albany, NY, I scheduled an appointment with him. Fortunately, my insurance covered the medical expenses, minus copays. I saw my local GI doctor one last time in April 2012. He greeted me with, ""Oh dear, you look anorexic."" He told me to reduce the stress in my life and to eat more. Uh duh. If I could eat more I would. Other than that, he refused to perform an ERCP and pretty much put the blame on me. At this point I was down to 105 pounds from 135 pounds September 2011. I hadn't been 105 pounds since I was 14! By May I was 95 pounds (a loss of 40 pounds since September 2011), and was now experiencing orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells and dizziness, muscle wasting, and loss of my cognitive abilities. I could not gain or sustain weight on my own. May 7, 2012, I flew with my mom to see the doctor in Minnesota. He strongly suspected SOD. He wanted to perform ERCP test, but I was so emaciated at this point that an ERCP could have killed me. Acute pancreatitis, a life-threatening condition, occurs in small percentages of people, after this procedure. While I was in Minnesota, he did have an associate perform another EUS and pancreatic functioning test. Both were fairly normal, except my bile duct was dilated and pancreatic duct had possible scarring (finally I had something show up on a test!). The doctor recommended in writing that I get a G/J feeding tube to bulk me up so I could have the ERCP done in August.  Upon my return to New York, and after going through a very difficult time trying to convince anyone to put the feeding tube in, I finally had a G/J tube inserted May 25, 2012 and began getting fed formual enterally through the J tube. I was able to eat minimal amounts of food, about 700-800 calories. The tube became a whole other set of issues. The j tube part that was supposed to stay in the small intestine kept migrating into my duodenum and stomach. I had to be hospitalized to have it replaced five times in two months. Also, none of the formulas were agreeing with me. It took two months to find the right one. But, by August I was able to get up to 109 pounds and flew back to Minnesota to have the ERCP.  No surprise here. I was diagnosed with SOD! Beyond a shadow of a doubt, I had SOD this whole time. Basal pressures of the sphincters are supposed to be less than 40 mm/hg. Mine were over 175 mm/hg. Most of the people I've met with SOD have pressures between 60 and 100 mm/hg. The Minnesota doctor also performed sphincterotomies (cutting) of my pancreatic and biliary sphincters. Unfortunately I was one of the few who ended up with acute pancreatitis after the procedure. I also developed an e-coli blood infection. I came very close to dying out there and ended up in ICU. After a week, I went home only to end up back in the hospital for nearly a week waiting to have my feeding tube replaced again because it had kinked. I found some relief for a good four-six weeks. Then I was hospitalized and had to have my temporary stents removed. Immediately, I returned to my original symptoms. While in that hospital, I met a surgeon who suggested a more permanent solution--a transduodenal sphincteroplasty, where the pancreatic and biliary sphincters are permanently sewed open to the duodenum. On October 3, 2012, I had open abdominal surgery for the sphincteroplasty. I ended up with a life-threatening infection, nearly dying again, and other issues. I was in the hospital for 4 weeks.  It is February 8, 2013. I have been able to maintain my weight on my own and three weeks ago had the feeding tubes removed for the first time since May 2012. My nausea is manageable, primarily due to the fact I am taking a gut motility drug called Domperidone, which I have to order from New Zealand as it isn’t available in the U.S. I don't vomit anymore or feel like I have a massive hangover every day I wake up. Also, my pain has been manageable. I don't need to take as many prescription pancreatic enzymes anymore, but still get some pancreatic discomfort and pain. I have had a few attacks of the right-sided SOD pain, but I think it is more of a phantom pain or something going haywire with my nerve endings. The severe fatigue and brain fog after eating has improved as well. My biggest problem is that I have developed nerve, muscle, and joint pain two months ago that I never had before the surgery. It is worse after I eat and when I wake up. A neurologist explained the neuropathy as critical illness neuropathy from going through septic shock. Still need an explanation for the joint pain, though. The greatest thing is that I am holding steady at 115 pounds!  Going undiagnosed for so long did a lot of damage to my entire body. I couldn't believe what starvation can do to a person's body and mind. It will take a long time to fully recover, if ever. I also have terrible PTSD from this horrible experience. I wonder how my life would be if I had gotten a diagnosis and treatment earlier. I have been on disability since May and it doesn't look like I'll be able to work anytime soon. I was a career woman, always in director and management positions for state and national not-for-profits. I used to travel all over the U.S. Now I am grateful for the days I can play with my toddler or attend my 16 year old's basketball game. My 25 year old son will be having a baby girl and I can't wait to meet my granddaughter. I have lost so much from this disease/disorder but thank God every day it hasn't taken my life, which it came close to doing. This process has put so much strain on my parents, husband, children, and friends. SOD is a very debilitating disease that should be taken more seriously by the healthcare profession as evidenced by my story. I hope by telling my story no one ever has to wait to get diagnosed or receive treatment for SOD.  Finally, a word on treatment. There's really no cure, no sure thing for SOD. It is not only disabling, it is incurable. Please spread the message far and wide that we ""SODers"" are suffering and often left forgotten. Advocate for research, better treatments, and less invasive testing--for all of us.",,pain,doctor,doctor,pound sterling,pound,sphincter,treatment,Primary Care,gold standard,surgeon
668,"Hello to everybody. I bumped into this website in one of the several moments of discomfort of my life. I was born with myelomeningocele, spina bifida, so I've been dealing with fecal incontinence my entire life.  I'm actually crying reading some of your posts, for the first time I feel someone is considering this problem as a burden that sometimes is just unbearable. I'm a 23 yr girl from Italy and I would like to share my story with you, hoping it might relieve someone else's pain, as your stories just did with mine.  As I said I was born with spina bifida and Currarino syndrome, I spent my infancy in and out of hospitals, but it wasn't awful, it was an experience that I will jealously keep in my heart. Fecal incontinence is the only disability I have, I've been so lucky not to have my legs injured! The real problem came with my early adolescence, I was literally thrown in a world of “normal” people, and I wasn't prepared, at all. The impact this disability had on my personality was immense, massive. It changed me, completely. I became cold and I just hide myself from everyone, the burden I wasn't prepared for was simply overwhelming. My parents gave all the medical care they could, but they weren't there when I needed them most. The loneliness which became an indelible part of me still makes me hold my breath so many times. I was a brilliant student, I then decided to apply to med school, probably because of this special bond I always had with hospitals, I think. it was during the first 3 years that the turning point came off: bulimia nervosa. I call it turning point because after some time I understand that the infinite struggle against bulimia was actually me, me trying to escape from the wall I built around myself, escaping from the immense ocean surrounding an island. They have been the most horrible years of my life, but I also had the courage to seek some help. I never talked about this disability to anyone, my family cannot even image how deep is the solitude I dug into myself.  Two years ago I started psychotherapy, I'm really better off now, I mean, bulimia is under control, but fecal incontinence isn't something that I can always control. I became aware of the fact that the thing I am mostly afraid of is being alone, I just realised I want to learn to love and to be loved, and this is something that I always kept out of my life, because I was ashamed, I felt inadequate, dirty, guilty (for letting me be overwhelmed despite I've seen people going through worse). I'm 23 and I've never had a boyfriend, I was never even able to tell my closest friends the real reasons why I never wanted to get close to a man. But now I want this to change, I injured myself, a lot, now I want to take care of me, but still I don't see how I can let someone else in this messy life.  Thank you a lot for sharing your stories, it really helped me realising that someone else feels the burden that we have to live with.

Thankfully she understands and is hoping for proper treatment. I cannot make plans to do anything because I can swell so much I literally need three sizes up from my normal size.  This happens sometimes with just water.  No one has provided me with any long term solution.  I am going to a teaching hospital near me next month as I cannot afford to bring myself physically or financially to the Mayo Clinic.  I am totally humiliated and sick all of the time.  I want to note that I am a highly motivated positive person. However, this unresolved condition is brining me down. As others have said I am afraid to eat anymore. I am getting to the point where I am eating next to nothing and relying on vitamins to keep me well.  If another Dr. implies that stress is the issue I am going to bring my sheets in.  I am not very stressed.  I am hoping for a solution for all of us.  This is so humiliating and disruptive. I send all of you positivity in my meditations.  I do want to say that I started taking dandelion root and it helps a bit with the swelling as it is a natural diuretic. It is my highest hopes that this condition gets resolved. I am reaching out to all people suffering in silence. You are not alone. I will make sure to keep everyone apprised of my next visit.

It all stated with a bout of salmonella...I am currently living in Mexico because my husband has been transferred here for what was supposed to be 2 years and we are now going on year 4. As I said this round started in May with a bout of salmonella,then parasites and on and on. Truthfully I have had trouble with diarrhea since I had my gallbladder removed in 2005. In the early time after that I had severe dumping syndrome. I still do always go after I eat,I take lots of Imodium if I plan to go out and use to take 10-12 just to go to work. I am severely stressed and am not satisfied with my diagnoses or treatment. I wanted to know if any of you feel nauseous when you are having an attack? Mine starts with 10 trips to the bathroom and then progresses to lots of cramping,burping and then the nausea which always follows with dry heaving and gagging . This is the part I can't handle..this is the part that sends me into a whirlwind of nervousness and unbelievable anxiety. I have asked for anti anxiety drugs and have been denied ..being told that I don't need them right now..all I can say is who,is a better candidate for some anxiety help than a person who is only well 1 week out of the month and then I can't enjoy that week because I'm waiting to become sick again?? I have also been diagnosed with diverticulosis. I would love to hear from any of you that have found medications that work.i want control of my life back and I know All of you understand how I feel. The doctors look at me as if I have nothing better to do so I'm there to play with them,it's very demeaning. My husband is getting tired of having a sick wife...I refuse to go out to eat anymore because of the salmonella,parasite issues. Thank you all for listening and I gladly welcome any of your help,advice or whatever you have to offer. Thanks,J",,anxiety,husband,nausea,doctor,doctor,job,medication,diverticulosis,person,candidate
672,"My first father’s day was certainly not as I had imagined.  We were in a strange city, in a huge hospital and within the upcoming days my wife, Tammy and I, would be making the most difficult decision so far in our lives.  Our only child, Madelyn Kate made her entrance into our world ten months earlier on her due date August 22, 2007.  We had prayed to conceive a child for four years.  Maddie was conceived with our third (and decidedly final) IVF attempt.  We knew we had been blessed with a miracle. I felt so ecstatic holding her that I found it difficult to breathe.  We realized that something was seriously wrong when Maddie began vomiting bile her second day of life and was unable to tolerate any feeding. Our roller coaster ride had begun.  We were told that she “must have some sort of intestinal obstruction” and that surgery would likely be required.  She was immediately transferred from Willow Creek to the NICU at Northwest Medical Center in Springdale.  My wife was having blood pressure issues and was recovering from a c-section and I would spend the next four days agonizing as I needed to be in two hospitals at once.  They had Maddie ingest some barium dye and took multiple x-rays as it passed through her digestive system.  To everyone’s surprise no true obstruction was found, but the transit time through her intestines was markedly delayed.   Her intestines functioned as if she were a 30 week old premature infant.  We were told that it should simply be a matter of weeks for her intestines to mature before we could take her home.  Within days her tummy became so distended it looked like she had a water melon in it and she screamed in pain.   A tube was inserted down thru her nose and taped to her face to drain the stomach contents so that she wouldn’t have to vomit them.  When the vomiting would quell for an hour or more they attempted feeding thru this same tube, a few drops at a time to no avail.  We could no sooner get her clean and dry that she would vomit again.  We felt helpless, desperate and frustrated!  After 3 weeks with no improvement, Maddie was flown to St. Louis Children’s Hospital, one of the top 5 children’s hospitals in the country.  We spent another few weeks trying to increase feeds by mouth and feeding tube.  Maddie was tested for every disease and disorder they could think of.  They tried numerous medications but nothing helped. One positive word or sign or test result would give us the strength to pull ourselves out of the next ditch we were thrown into with bit of bad news.  We overheard one doc tell another, “we’ve given up feeding her” and we were heartbroken. My wife set up a caring bridge site in order to communicate with our extended family and friends as reliving the stories of each days events just became too painful for her to repeat over and over on the phone.  She spent much of her time weeping while rocking Maddie for hours in the dark lonely NICU room.  In the absence of a cause for Madelyn’s intestinal failure, a tentative diagnosis of chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction was made.  Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) is a rare disorder of gastrointestinal motility where coordinated contractions (peristalsis) in the intestinal tract become altered and inefficient. When this happens, nutritional requirements cannot be adequately met.  At 6 weeks old she had 4 full thickness small intestine biopsies and her first central line placed.  A central line is a tiny catheter that is place in a vein just under the skin in the chest and then threaded through the blood vessel all the way to the tip of the heart.  All of her nutrition would now go through this IV line. It was around this time that my wife asked one of the doctors “is pseudo-obstruction something that could kill her?” The reply was, “I don’t think we can answer that just yet”.  Madelyn had been on TPN (total parental nutrition or IV nutrition) 24 hours a day since shortly after birth.  This was causing liver damage and she was shockingly jaundiced.  The catch 22 with TPN and a central line is that although it gives the nutrition needed to survive, it can cause the liver to fail and/or life threatening blood infections, metabolic bone disease and anemia.  Incredibly, we found a pediatric GI motility expert (one of a handful in the country) about 2 hours away in Kansas City, who we were able to speak to at length on the phone.  When Maddie was 10 weeks old we transferred to Kansas City.  The doctor was able to perform a test that would give us a definitive diagnosis of intestinal pseudo-obstruction.  We felt relief that we knew what to call it, but devastated that there is no cure and that she would be “chronically ill” for life.  She was in surgery the next day to have a permanent feeding tube put in her stomach, an ileostomy placed and more intestinal biopsies.   The “feeding” tube allows us to drain the bile and formula (or food) that has backed up into her stomach as needed to hopefully prevent vomiting.  She had a very difficult time recovering from surgery.  Two days before Thanksgiving we were able to take her home for the first time.  She was on 20 hours of TPN per day and pre digested formula mixed ½ strength continuously running through her feeding tube.  Learning to handle her IV nutrition, tube feeds and ostomy care was terrifying, even with the help of 5 grandparents, other family, and many friends.  We rarely slept more than 2 hours at a time and it was very hard to think straight.  The first year she threw up about 30 times a day, around the clock.  You have never seen two people jump out of bed and change a crib, a onesie and move some laundry through with the speed and teamwork we have.  We were told that if Maddie made it through the first year of life that she would probably do well.  The statistics are that 1/3 of infants with pseudo-obstruction on TPN die within the first year due to liver failure or blood infection.  Maddie’s liver disease was significant enough that we were referred for a small bowel/pancreas/liver transplant evaluation in Omaha, NE when she was 10 months old.  They were very concerned that her liver was near failure.  It was during this transplant evaluation that we “celebrated” my 1st Fathers Day.  The transplant surgeon said point blank, “your daughter has a fatal disease, not unlike cancer, and a transplant is her best chance at long term survival.”  We were completely shocked.  The one year survival rate for this transplant was 90% and five year survival rate 60%.  We were in the process of getting FDA approval for two investigational drugs used only for emergency or life saving purposes.  After much careful consideration, prayer and counsel from our two GI doctors we chose not to list her for multi-organ transplant at the time.  We chose to continue to “limp along” as we had been.  Over the next three months Maddie’s bilirubin and liver function tests miraculously started to normalize. Although, we had finally received FDA approval for both emergency drugs we only needed one of them.  The first year of her life wasn’t marked by weeks or months of age, but by which hospital we were at.  Ultimately, we spent the first year of her life in 8 different hospitals in 5 different states. It was the most difficult year of our lives.  We pray to never suffer the pain that we experienced during that first year, ever.  We have been fortunate that an intestinal failure team has been set up at Arkansas Children’s Hospital and they work closely with our GI motility specialist (who is now in New Orleans) as needed.  Maddie is 3.5 now and is on 18 hours per day of TPN.  She is allowed to eat small amounts of certain foods by mouth for pleasure.  It is important that she not develop any food or eating aversion.  We have never been successful with tube feeding even a teaspoon per hour.  She is treated for her anemia with weekly IV Iron Infusions and is on constant rotating antibiotics for small bowel bacterial overgrowth.  She has emergency approval for a drug called Zelnorm which she gets 2 times per day.  We drain her feeding tube overnight and when she tells us she is “sick”.  She hasn’t needed a blood transfusion in over a year.  We see our GI doctor in Little Rock every two months and as needed.  She is very susceptible to fracture and has suffered a femur fracture and most recently a broken bone in her foot.  Some people can tolerate TPN for many, many years.  Some children have a difficult time growing while on it.  So far Maddie has not.  We take it one day at a time and sometimes five minutes at a time.   We try not to live in constant fear but sometimes it is very difficult.  Each fever takes our minds on an odyssey to its darkest corners where no parent should have to travel.  A place that most parents don’t ever have to experience and those that do usually don’t speak of.  Is this the fever that points to a line infection that leads to a sepsis “the number one killer of children on TPN” that kills MY child? The what if’s take over, more so when we are tired and feeling desperate.   She sleeps in the bed next to ours and we love having her so close to us.  We do not ever want to regret not spending even five minutes with her.  Our life is about her and we thank God daily for giving us the opportunity to take care of her and for all the joy she brings to our family and friends.  She has changed many lives.  We pray for better transplant outcomes, a stem-cell breakthrough or cure, and better drugs to treat motility disorders.  This father’s day, my 4th, certainly won’t be as I had imagined.  We have just returned from a strange city, after staying near a magical place called Disney World.  We are so thankful to Make A Wish Foundation and Give Kids the World for making Maddie’s wish to meet princesses, like herself, in person.  Will pseudo-obstruction kill her?  We don’t know the answer to that yet.  What we do know is that miracles do occur, dreams do come true and wishes are granted.  And we are so thankful for our family and friends who have helped us immensely along the way.",,liver,feeding,transplant,child,nutrition,line,disease,drug,friend,husband
673,"My nephew, Gabriel, who is now 6 years old, was diagnosed with Hirschprung’s disease  when he was born. Only three days after he was born doctors had to perform an emergency descending colostomy because of the magnitude of his obstruction. Everything went wrong from there. We live in Colombia, South America, and doctors have proven to have little knowledge about this illness. My sister is a user of our public health system, which narrows the possibility to access quality and specialized health care for Gabriel.  The biopsy results from a sample obtained at the “colostomy mouths” right after the surgery in 2005, showed “normal innervations”. However, in 2006, a colorectal biopsy showed the absence of nerve cells (aganglioniosis) near the endorectal area. In 2007, the results from another study show absence of nerve cells in portions of the bowel near the “union of the glandular and squamous epithelium” and the anus. In 2008, a second review of those results contradicts them, saying the area studied is “normally aganglionic”.  In January 2008 Gabriel had a pull through (reconnection) surgery with 10 centimeters of his bowel removed. The results from the study of the part removed showed “presence of nerve cells in all of the section”. However, it also stated that some of the sections show “changes in the sub mucous plexus that fill the criteria proposed by Meier Ruge for Neuronal Intestinal Dysplasia ”. Only one month after his pull through surgery, Gabriel had painful and chronicle constipation episodes for the next six months, spending most of his time at the ER getting painful enemas, which led the doctors to perform back a colostomy and “continue to study his case”.  Imagine our frustration and my sister’s suffering with all of this. It has been a long journey where the medical prognostics have been misleading and confusing. Due to the lack of a good health care service, Gabriel has seen many doctors and been attended in many public hospitals of the city, all giving him no hope for recovery and advising him to adjust to the colostomy for the rest of his life. My sister has presented many legal actions to demand a better service, the provision of colostomy bags, appliances, vitamin supplements, etc., which are very expensive and unaffordable for her otherwise. Gabriel is a brave, smart and vivacious child, who has understood very quickly the ups and downs of his medical condition. The toughest part for him and for us as well is probably the side things that have come with it, such as the rejection from kids at school (and even from schools who are afraid to receive him), the poor growth (apparently he has the size of a 4 year old) and the intolerance to many meals that cause him severe diarrhea and ""accidents"" with the colostomy.  In addition to all of this, he has develop a new illness, which no one has been able to diagnose. He feels terrible crumbles near the anal area and expels some fetid liquids. Sometimes he is not even able to move from bed for a period of one or two days. Doctors say this could be the waste from the Colon that need to come out or something like that, but they are unable to ease his pain and cure this simptoms. We wonder how if he has a colostomy, the anus can expel anything. Another doctor told us this could be a sign of Colon cancer. Imagine that.  My sister is a great woman, whose husband left the house. However she has managed to do every possible human effort to keep Gabriel alive and emotionally healthy. I of course, being a single and having more education and a job, try to support my family shoulder to shoulder (for example, using my knowledge of the English language to do this), but it isn’t an easy fight.  I truly hope we could get some advice from doctors or share experiences with people who is going through the same we are. We are even interested in getting information about clinical trials in the U.S. or anywhere else. Should the Foundation or someone else needs additional medical information, we are willing to provide it.  Thank you very much and God bless the vital job you do.",,doctor,doctor,sister,result,medical care,area,cell,medical,cell,surgery
674,"I am Michele Wilson from Simi Valley, California and I am a single mom. My seven year old son, Jovaan started having gastroenterologist intestinal problems when he was 4 months old. We were living in Florida when my son was first born and I remember my son would cry often, especially after I nursed him and I was told by his pediatrician that he had colic.  After one of Jovaan's immunization is when I first noticed blood in my son's stool. I called his pediatrician immediately and he assured me that the blood in his stool was not caused from his immunization. However, my son continued to have blood in his stool and was always fussy. For over a two month period I made several calls to my son's pediatrician and made multiple trips to the doctor's office regarding his condition when finally my son pediatrician referred me Pediatric GI Specialist in Orlando. His GI doctor in Orlando performed a biopsy and diagnosed my son as having colitis. He was treated with a seven day dose of steroids; however I did not see much of an improvement. Jovaan was also seen by an immunologist and he tested positive for several food allegories, so I learned how to control some of his symptoms through diet.  I can't begin to tell you how many specialist my son had seen the first 5 years of his life. His doctors took multiple tests over the years. He was actually misdiagnosed for several years with having colitis. Every time I would take him to these doctors, I felt like I was never taken seriously. Majority of the time Jovvan's blood test would come back positive with inflammation. Each time we would see a new doctor they would basically say the same thing. ""We know there is something wrong but we just don't know what it is."" My son had severe constipation: he would also rock back and forth all the time (now I know it was due to pain). One pediatrician prescribed MiraLAX daily which was really difficult for my son because it caused severe cramping and diarrhea since he was going to school at the time it was very difficult for him to control his bowels.  Jovaan also had a never ending appetite, he was hungry all the time yet he was not gaining weight (he weighed the same for almost 6 years). Jovaan would eat so much his stomach would get so impacted and bloated that I had to give him an enema to relieve him each experience was very traumatic for him.  Then my son began to see an Endocrinologist and was diagnose with Failure to Thrive at age three because he was not gaining weight or growing. He was so below the growth chart that he was also prescribed growth hormones, which have to be injected in the form of shots daily. The growth hormone has not been as effective as they should due to his underlying health problems.  On October 15, 2009, life stopped when Jovaan became chronically ill (he was six at the time) and he was rushed to UCLA Children's Hospital which became our home for the next 5 months. I can't even begin to describe the pain and suffering, Jovaan went through. After weeks of evasive testing so the doctor's had to rule out everything else before they finally diagnosed with a rare medical disorder, called Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction Syndrome which has to do with the motility of the colon and the doctors said there is no cure for his condition at this time. There is also no specific test for Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction Syndrome that is why the doctor's had to perform so many tests and took weeks to diagnose my son's condition.  Chronic Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction Syndrome is a condition in which the intestines react as if there is a true mechanical obstruction or blockage. However, when tests are performed, no physical evidence of blockage is found. There is no unique sign or symptom that allows a positive diagnosis of the pseudo-obstruction. Symptoms of pseudo-obstruction vary in presentation and severity. The most common symptoms in children are nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and pain, and constipation. Other symptoms include, diarrhea, early satiety (fullness), food aversion, and weight loss may also be present. Over time, pseudo-obstruction can cause bacterial infections, malnutrition, and muscle problems in other parts of the body. My son had all these symptoms. In November 2009, the day after Thanksgiving, Jovaan had his first surgery to temporary disconnect his colon and give him a loop ileostomy which is a surgical opening constructed by bringing the loop of small intestine (the ileum) out onto the surface of the skin.    The darkest moment of my life is when the doctors came in and told me that they wanted to perform another surgery and remove Jovaan's colon, I really wanted to get a second opinion, but because of his condition was so rare there were only hand full of doctors in the country who specialized in this disorder and my son's conditions was so acute that the doctor's only gave me 24 hours to decide because they felt this was his only chance to have a quality life.  On February 19, 2010 the doctors performed another surgery on my six year old son Jovaan, and they removed his colon (a colectomy). My son now has an ileostomy bag. Due to his malnutrition, Jovaan has an IV line placed in his vein on the right side of his chest and is feed TPN (Intravenous Parenteral Nutrition) 10 hours a night. The first year was very challenging for my son and me because no matter how much I tried to keep his line cleaned from infections he was hospitalized eight times due to bacteria and fungus infection so far he's had to have three line replacements.  Jovaan has not been able to attend school on a regular basis because of the chronic health issues associated with his condition.  I really feel that due to the lack of awareness in the medical field my son's condition was not properly diagnosed. I truly believe if his condition was properly diagnosed in the early stages his condition would not have developed into its acute stage other treatment options for his condition could have been done. His colectomy could have been avoided.",,son,condition,doctor,doctor,exam,ambulatory,growth hormone,blood,obstruction,pain
675,"Sophia Grace Dummer was born on May 20, 2011 at 7:00 AM, at 32 weeks gestation.  She was baby B in a set of triplets.  At 2 days old she was diagnosed with Ileal Atresia and had her first surgery.  We were then told that she acquired strictures and would need another surgery.  Her third surgery was preformed at 3 months and she has a stoma and a fistula.  And 10 days after that she needed a yet another surgery.  At this point we decided to transfer to Children’s Hospital in Milwaukee, WI.  Once there two additional surgeries were preformed.  That totals 6 surgeries in 6 months, an almost unheard of amount for intestinal surgery.  Her surgeon at Children’s found rare conditions were she is allergic to surgical sutures, and pseudo-obstruction disorder.  Without finding their staff I have no idea where our journey would have led us.  Now she has a GJ tube and a Broviac central line.  She gets about 1/4th of her food from her J-tube and we drain her G at night.  She is still TPN dependent.  We now start the journey of healing and learning how to live with this condition.  We know that it will be a long one, but with a great support system it is a journey that we are ready to take.  We are very proactive and when we got her diagnosis I was amazed at how little is known about her condition.  Sophia has the strength to fight whatever comes her way, now research is what is needed to help her.  People come up to us on a daily basis and say how sorry for us they are.  When they look at Sophia they may see a sick little girl with cords and pumps.   Yes, we do have daily struggles and would do anything to make her better.  As her mom, I feel privileged to get to go on the journey of life with her, no matter where that may lead.   When  I look at Sophia, I see an amazing little girl that has already taught me so much.  I know that one day she will be a great woman, who will change this world for the better, just because she is in it.",,surgery,condition,child,staff,world,woman,mother,pump,cord,people
676,"Hi, I am a 31 year old woman who was diagnosed with gastroparesis in 2008. I've suffered with digestive issues on and off from the age of 19, shortly after undergoing laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis and ovarian cysts. At the age of 28, after years of pain and discomfort, a gastric emptying test confirmed mild GP. At the time I decided to take a natural route and went on a gluten free diet, which for about six months seemed to change my life for the better. Unfortunately, this did not last and I began having severe symptoms including fullness and nausea, barely able to take in fluids. I ended up in the hospital having what seemed like every test in the book done, again diagnosed with GP.  With medication, rest and lots of family/friends support, I began to recover and a year later began a full time course in acupuncture school. I absolutely loved the program but traveling to and from every week (90 minutes away from home), missing my husband, not to mention the intense study schedule, was more than I could handle. By the end of the first year I had lost a tremendous amount of weight, in denial of my diagnosis and determined to live a ""normal"" life. However, my body did not keep up with my mind and again I ended up in the hospital, this time too malnourished to recover on my own. After unsuccessful trials with another medication and a Botox treatment to the pylorus, I had no choice but to be put on a feeding tube. This is when it hit me...it was time to accept the situation and really focus on taking care of myself because I will not make it otherwise.  By accepting what I was going through as a part of my life, I was able to slow down and set priorities. I now focus on managing symptoms through diet, exercise and reducing stress. I've found other things to focus on in life while continuing to put self-care first. Though still on the feeding tube, my intake of food througout the day is increasing as I gradually work my way off. This doesn't mean I don't still have bad days but I have learned how to manage them by not letting the fear take over as well as figuring out what works and what doesn't.  I began writing about my experience on a blog ( www.journeywithgp.com ), learning more and more about GP and how many others were going through similar battles. In January I started a program through the Institute for Integrative Nutrition to become a certified health coach, specializing in gastroparesis. I'm excited share and use my experience as a learning tool for others, to focus on the things we can do to help ourselves instead of dwelling on the things we can't. I never would have imagined this would be my life at the age of 31 but it hasn't stopped me from continuing to stay positive, hope for a cure someday, and in the meantime live the best life possible.",,feeding,program,medication,diet,exam,laparoscopic surgery,reducing,body,Botox,treatment
677,"I grew up with two parents who had constant heartburn. Dad always had antacids in his pocket and mom kept them on her nightstand. I just thought it was a thing that all adults suffered from. So when I started to suffer from heartburn in college, I didn’t think of it as something I should seek treatment for. I just started buying big bottles of antacids and sleeping on a pile of pillows to elevate my head. I put on too much weight during grad school, and between eating a students’ poor diet, the excess weight, and the stress, heartburn became just a way of life.  When I was about 30 I got a job at a hospital. One of the doctors saw me popping antacids after lunch and asked if I had ever talked to my doctor about my heartburn. He was shocked that I had never even mentioned it! I consider myself an educated person but that was the first time I heard that long term heartburn can be a sign of GERD, and that going too long untreated, GERD can lead to esophageal cancer.  I found a doctor in the hospital who was doing a clinical trial on people with untreated GERD. I got a free endoscopy as part of the trial, and I was lucky to find that I didn’t have any damage to my esophagus despite years without treatment. I was told to follow up with my primary care doctor and get treatment. She put me on a proton pump inhibitor and I can’t tell you how amazing it was – I took the first pill, and that night for the first time in years I didn’t have heartburn! She told me I’d probably need to be on PPIs the rest of my life if I didn’t want the heartburn to come back.  I started trying to make other changes – eating smaller dinners and not eating right before bedtime – and within a few months I was able to cut back to one pill every other day. But boy if I forgot which day I was on and missed a pill, the GERD came back with a vengeance.  It took another five years for me to find the willpower to start making serious changes to improve my health. I started bicycling in 2008, and started losing a lot of weight. Part of my diet plan was to stop eating at all after about 3pm. Now I no longer need the PPIs.  However, this doesn’t mean I’m “cured” of my GERD. I still have to use antacids on the rare occasions that I eat too close to bedtime or have too large of a meal. It’s still there, waiting for me to slip back into bad habits, and it always will be. It’s just like any other chronic disease. I just wish I had learned earlier that heartburn is not something you have to live with, that treatments and lifestyle changes exist that can help. Good luck to all of you who are still struggling.",,treatment,doctor,doctor,weight,weight,pill,diet,chronic disease,clinical trial,Primary Care
678,"3 years ago, I embarked on a journey unlike anything I could have ever imagined. I have gone from a strong, independent nurse, wife, and mother to a shell of a person barely able to get up and go each day…to the ""new me"" – A good person, dealt a bad hand, and doing her best to live each day to its fullest.  My tummy story started in the spring of 2009. I was having some issues with nausea and indigestion that was initially brushed off as “probably an ulcer”. From there I began to have chest pain/pressure, heartburn, and severe nausea. Nothing I did seemed to have much of an effect. Over a 6 month period, I would return to my doctor 3 times with these complaints. I was given a variety of diagnoses, from pleurisy to GERD, but none of the treatments helped. I developed pain in my side and back, and started to notice feeling full quickly no matter what I ate. Previously a REAL foodie, and a little overweight at 150 pounds, my diet dwindled to mainly cereal and toast.  I changed primary care doctors and went to 2 GI practices looking for answers. It took 12 more months, 2 trips to the ER, 6 procedures, 6 medications, over $8000 out of pocket, more calls to argue with my insurance company than I care to remember, and countless hours on the internet searching for answers before someone FINALLY ordered a gastric emptying study (at my request) and diagnosed my gastroparesis.  Though I had the diagnosis, there was little guidance on how to live with it. I was given a hand out of some foods to avoid, and the doctor told me “it won’t kill you, but some days you’ll wish you were dead.” I remember thinking that was the most insensitive thing I’d ever heard! Every day was exhausting. I had to take multiple breaks just to get ready each morning. I was nauseated, dizzy, and barely making it through each day. Looking back, there were very few days I didn’t cry, and it turns out that doctor was right.  I hit a low of 100 pounds in January 2011, and faced hard choices regarding my nutritional status (such as feeding tubes/IV nutritional support). Everywhere I went, people whispered about why I wasn’t eating or why I had lost so much weight. We live in a small town, and the rumor mill had given me everything from an eating disorder to cancer. And worse yet, other people would tell me how great I looked and ask what I was doing to lose so much weight.  Physically and emotionally, I was worn out and struggling to find help. It has been a long road. To date I have tried 12 prescription meds: some with FDA blackbox warnings, some that needed compounded because they aren’t available here otherwise, and many of which aren’t covered by insurance because they aren’t “proven” treatments. Most importantly, I’ve learned the importance of being my own advocate and doing my own research.  It is VERY hard to find a practitioner that has real experience with treating gastroparesis patients. Through trial and error, and networking other GPers, I have learned to battle my symptoms and my food intake to avoid the severe dehydration and malnourishment. I am happy to say I have gained around 7-8 pounds and am able to maintain it fairly well. And I continue to read, study, and search for ideas to help manage my condition so that I can live better. But while I have done well with learning to deal with my physical health, I am still fighting quite a psychological battle.  My life changed drastically. I hate talking about my illness, because that makes it real to me. But hiding from the facts only makes things worse. I’m not the old me but accepting that has been so hard. I love to and live to cook. But FOOD network just isn’t the same when you can only dream of tasting all of those recipes. Planning ANYTHING is terribly stressful – never know if it will be a good tummy day or a bad one. And hearing my kids say, “don’t ask mom, she doesn’t feel good. “ or “mom, you just rest, dad can help us” just cuts deep.  My whole identity has changed. I can honestly say I don’t think there is one aspect of my life, not one, that hasn’t been effected by gastroparesis. I’m lucky in that I have an amazing family that supports me, and as my husband points out, I am just hard headed enough to not let anything beat me. But this journey is not for the faint of heart.

679,"I started running when I was 22. Over the last 18 years, I have run dozens of races and completed 8 marathons while living with chronic illness. I have gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) which causes severe stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. There is no cure for this condition and only a few treatments available which offer temporary relief.  After many years of failed treatments, hospitalizations and feeding tubes, I had a gastric neurostimulator (stomach pacemaker) implanted on March 3, 2011. While the pacemaker has provided some relief, my symptoms continue to be debilitating. I continue to run whenever possible even when I’m experiencing stomach pain and nausea. However, there are many days that I cannot run because of vomiting and fatigue.  I did not run for weeks when I met Joan Benoit Samuelson at the Credit Union Cherry Blossom 10 Miler Expo. During her talk, she kept repeating “run your own race” – inspiring words that I needed to hear at the time. It can be an emotional struggle when I want to run but my body won’t let me. It is especially difficult when I see my identical twin sister running consistently and surpassing her race goals.  I have learned that I cannot compare myself to my twin or any other runner. I cannot even compare myself to the runner I was before I got sick. My body has changed and my running has changed. I have become the “go with the flow” slow runner and that is the runner I am meant to be today. I am truly grateful for every step that I am able to run. I appreciate every moment when I run – that is why I run without expectations, without time goals, without music, without a Garmin, but always with gratitude.  On her photo, Joan Benoit Samuelson wrote “Wishing you a great run through life” and I am determined to do just that! My twin and I dubbed ourselves “Twins Run in Our Family” since we are identical twins and opposite runners. We run together to support Alex’s Lemonade Stand for Childhood Cancer in memory of Leah’s brother-in-law Michael who died of leukemia on March 17. 2003 and our grandmother GG who died of cancer on July 16, 2012.

680,"In the past 9 months I’ve been called anorexic, a drug addict (due to track marks left by 15+ blown ivs), and a seeker. I've been told it was all in my head, asked how bad a stomach ache could really be, diagnosed with IBS, told it was a chronic condition, and even that it was psychosomatic. It wasn't all bad, as I was also called brave, inspirational, tough and a hero. I've felt worthless, a burden, and not worthy of being a mother or wife. I've had a triple barium ct scan, xrays galore, a colonoscopy, an endoscopy, stool sampling, a gall bladder sonogram, countless blood test, a HIDA scan, and a small bowel follow through, 2 GETs, EEG of the stomach, and coming up I have to have nerve conduction testing done and autonomic lab testing, as well as ANA Blood testing.  I've lost 61 pounds, my skins broken down, I have a BMI of 15.2. I have thrown up and or been nauseated every second of every day. I suffer from insomnia. I am on 7 different medications every 6 hours. I fall asleep sitting up and can’t walk alone. I went from going to the gym 5 days a week to not being able to pull myself up out of bed. My hair began falling out due to malnutrition. I have spent countless days in the hospital and began passing out last November. Because of this I now have an added Neurology to my dream team of doctors. My bed has become my prison. I spent my 32nd birthday, Thanksgiving, Valentine’s Day and my Anniversary in a hospital.  I've had to learn how and what to eat and who my true friends were. I've missed friends, events and even special occasions. My mom has had surgery, my older sister had skin cancer and my baby sister is having a hysterectomy that I can’t be there for.  So who am I really? I am none of the things people have called or said about me. I’m a survivor who finally got a diagnosis. I am a mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt and friend. I have Gastroparesis! I have GP, it doesn't have me!  I have suffered so long because most doctors and nurses don't remember that world beyond school.  Who will I become? An advocate who will shortly begin to raise awareness so that no one else has to suffer the Hell I have.  Most importantly I am a Christian who wouldn't be a survivor had it not been for the hundreds of people praying for me and never letting me give up, even when I was begging them to let me.

681,"Worth it in the end.....  My story began almost 20 years ago when I promised my best-friend that I would donate my kidney to her should she ever need one after her father passed away of polycystic kidney disease because, she too, suffered from the same disease. I never dreamed that I God would have it in His plan for me to actually be her donor. On September 20, 2007, I donated my kidney to my best-friend. After doing so, I was never the same.  It started out with severe muscular problems. I had pain all over my body. A year following the surgery, I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. In December 2008, I began vomiting and could not eat. April of 2009 was my first hospitalization after not eating for over 20 days. After numerous test, scopes and more hospitalizations, I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis.  I have tried all forms of treatment from medications, Botox treatments, acupuncture and nothing has worked. I currently have a G/J tube for feedings and drainage. I have been told that I am not a candidate for the gastric pacer.  In February of 2009 my friend went into rejection of my kidney. She fought so hard to keep my kidney but had to have it removed a year later.  Sadly, she passed away this past November of complications of her kidney disease.  She called me her hero, but  she was the real fighter and the real hero. I have never seen someone fight for their life as much as she did. I miss her terribly but I know I have an angel in Heaven watching over me.  I am so grateful to have the most wonderful support system in my husband, my parents and my friends.  My husband has taken such good care of me.  My parents are here whenever I have needed them and my friends have rallied around me to provide meals, take me to doctor appointments, sit with me in the hospital, and even clean my house!  Without any of these people, I wouldn't be handling this disease nearly as well.  That I know for sure.",,friend,disease,parent,husband,hero,hospitalization,treatment,polycystic kidney disease,grateful,rejection
682,"The unexpected twists and turns of life...  It all began for me with a good deed. My sweet, adorable, beloved 6-month-old niece had a terminal liver disease and needed a transplant to survive. I felt called to be her donor...for reasons I will most likely never fully understand I knew immediately that I was the one who was meant to be her donor. Despite my busy life as a wife, mother of two young children, and professor, I knew instantly that I would be a match. After extensive testing, I learned that indeed I was a perfect match, another clear sign of the course my life was meant to take since only about 3% of those who want to donate match and qualify. The transplant went very well, and my niece began her long and difficult road to recovery, armed with an incredible amount of strength and resilience. I too began the long road to recovery, having no idea just how much that surgery had changed the course that my life would take.  Almost immediately after the surgery I knew that my stomach was not right. The first three months were filled with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a complete lack of appetite. We all, including my doctors, attributed all of this to recovery, but after three months it was clear that there was something wrong. Scopes, tests, and innumerable doctor's visits later my problems had names....GERD, gastroparesis, injury to the Vagus nerve....names that are now a part of who I am, whether I want them to be or not.  My life literally went from 90mph to 10mph overnight. From a frenetic working mom to a woman who spends most of her time alone at home, saving up her energy or her ""spoons"" so that she can put on a good show or her best game face for the family each afternoon and evening. From a professor who stood and taught for four hours straight to a professor who sits and teaches a four hour class in a seminar style, with the help of a doctoral student. From a mom who tried to do it all, to a woman lying in bed while friends decorate her house for Christmas, rake her leaves, and do odd jobs around the house.  And yet, oddly enough, I am happier now.....not every day, but most days. I am calm and at peace, and grateful that my niece and I are both alive. I am grateful for the babysitter who treats my children with so much love, and my husband who is far more incredible and competent than I ever allowed him to demonstrate. For the family and ""village"" who has stepped up to the plate in more ways than I can even name, and never made me feel even an ounce of guilt for asking for so much. And for two children, ages 8 and 6 who have shown me more maturity, empathy, and strength than I had ever imagined possible, as they make me ""bathroom beds"", bring me cool cloths, snuggle in my bed when I just can't even get to the couch, and give me innumerable hugs and kisses. And suddenly, even though I am now that lady sitting on the bench at the art fair next to several elderly folks with canes, I am smiling, because I am there, and that is enough for today.  People tell me that I am a hero; that I saved my niece's life. I really view it in the opposite way. Before the transplant I was overweight and did not take time to eat right or exercise regularly. I was moving through my life at such a rapid speed that I rarely stopped to enjoy the moment, felt anxiety almost constantly, and had no idea how to put myself and my family first and say no! I don't even want to think about where I would have ended up if my life had continued in that horrible way, and am thankful that I don't have to. My niece is alive and healthy and I am a new person...yes, my stomach is a mess and there are many days that I can't leave my house because I am so sick, but I am living a life of purpose, with my mind in the present and my heart filled with a renewed feeling of love and calmness that I could never have imagined.  I will continue to try every therapy, medication, and treatment possible to reach a point where I can wake up without feeling as though my body is failing. I cling to the wish that one day I will wake up and my skin will be pain free, the sheets will not hurt, my stomach will not be clenched in pain, and I will have the energy that someone my age should have. I work towards the goal of riding my bike again, taking my sweet dog for a walk, and running in the front yard with my children. I hope and pray for researchers and doctors to find something, anything to repair my Vagus nerve. But if that doesn't come, and if there is no fix, I pray for peace and strength, so that I will continue to find comfort in the good deed that I did and be humble enough to know that I need to ask for help, accept my situation, and get as much joy out of every moment of this life as I possibly can.",,nephew,home,child,recovery,bed,family,stomach,transplant,mother,professor

Many trips back and forth to the doctors and many test. I never heard of it before but did alot of research on it since then. Then in 2008 I became diable, I have a rare disorder that effects the upper part of my back that had changed my life completely. There is not to much I can do and what I am able to do can only do for 5 to 15 minutes at a time depending on what it is. I am a very independant person that loves to do things for myself.

Through the past few years I have other problems arrive that keep setting me back further and further. Now we come to the here and now. Last week I was diagnosed with Diabetic Gastroparesis. I never heard of it before. It is very rare in diabetics and I said to the doctor,I am getting used to things being rare. So he preceded to tell me what it was. I was totally devasted and thought this can't be happening. He basiclly told me that I have to change my lifestyle. How much more do I have to give up.He told me to go to my dietisan and she will help me with what I have to do. Also get in tough with my diabetic care giver and my GP. Well that was a joke. I thought here we go again figuring things out for myself. I have been doing research now for a week,but everything I find is telling me what I can't have and not what I can have. I have lost 6kg in a week. That is all well and good as I am a diabetic but am I getting all the nutriants that I need. I live in a country that does not have a big variety of food that I was used to in Canada .

687,"I am a 24-year-old female. Throughout my childhood I suffered with constant GI problems. My parent's told me that when I was a baby I could projectile vomit like you would not believe. As long as I could remember, I would throw up almost daily. It was fairly random and just became a part of my life. Later on, when I was in my teens I had horrible problems swallowing. I would have to have a huge glass of water near me to be able to eat and get the food down. This was chalked up to not chewing my food well enough, although I KNEW that was not the case.  I was 18, and it was the day before I was to leave for college. I was packing and loading up a U-Haul. I stopped for a quick lunch of leftovers out of the refrigerator. I ate some chicken alfredo. I ended up getting a piece of the chicken stuck in my throat. I first tried taking a big swig of water to push it down with no luck. The water would come right back up. My boyfriend and my sister both tried to give me the Heimlich Maneuver with no success. I could still breathe, although not well.  I went to the doctor and he didn't even examine me. He tried to force me to drink some water, which I did end up doing, but it stuck in my throat and eventually came back up, as I told him it would. He told me I was just panicking and had probably irritated my vocal cords and gave me a shot of Ativan.  I went back home and was so miserable. I could just barely breathe and it seemed as if no one would help me!  My family took me out to supper that night since I was to leave for college the next day. I couldn't eat, but I sat with them. I went to the bathroom at the restaurant and was coughing and gagging and guess what...a piece of chicken came flying out of my throat. I showed it to my mother to prove I wasn't crazy.  It was a very discouraging experience and it was miserable.  I suffered with severe dysphagia for another year or so before I went to another physician. After hearing of my symptoms he told me that I definitely was not crazy and needed to see a GI specialist for a EGD immediately.  I got the EGD and found out I had scaring in my esohpagus, esophagitis, a hiatal hernia, severe GERD, and a Schatzki ring.  I was put on reflux medication. The doctor said the EGD procedure itself dilated my Schatzki ring enough that no further procedures were required.  I suffered with all of these problems for my entire life up until I was 19-20-years-old. I was so used to the pain, burning, discomfort, and emesis that I didn't even know what it felt like to feel better until I did.  I am so thankful for the doctor that took the time to listen to me and really help me. After seeing the first doctor I felt as if I were crazy and was then just embarrassed.  I still have flare-ups and am well aware I will require another EGD and dilation of my Schatzki ring in the future, but I am so glad to have this persistent problem figured out. I only wish it could have been figured out in my youth so I wouldn't have all of the scarring and other problems now.",,doctor,doctor,chicken,throat,ring,ring,food,ring,hernia,dinner
688,"I must agree with many of the people who have posted on this site that IBS can be very isolating and debilitating. I've been struggling with IBS since my early 20's and I am now 52. I've been on various medications and have been instructed to increase my fiber intake, as I primarily suffer from diarrhea - but nothing has really helped.  My symptoms went away for several years but in the past 6 months have returned. In addition to the cramping and churning of my stomach, I find that I also get low back pain and a slight headache after an episode. The uncomfortable churning and gurgling will often continue for hours - I usually experience 3-4 bouts of diarrhea during this time frame but the low back pain and headache will remain for almost a full day. I feel as though I've got a hangover - only thing is, I haven't had anything to drink! There is no ""rhyme or reason"" to the attacks, either. Sometimes, they come on within a few hours after eating something or drinking coffee, while other times, I can eat or drink the exact same things and feel fine. After an episode, I will go for 10 days to 2 weeks with no problems - and then all of a sudden it will hit again without warning. This is the worst part of it to me because I never know when it's going to ""seize"" me. Immodium is always something I carry with me as well as peppermint tea - that seems to calm the grumbling and churning in my stomach, although only temporarily.  I didn't notice that anyone else on here experiences the headache, back pain and general ""hangover"" feeling after an episode. If anyone does I would appreciate hearing what you are doing to manage it because I hate that I just have to ""endure"" it until it passes. It even affects my sleep so I am also extremely fatigued the following day.  Comment  I get back aches with an attack of diarrhea as well.

690,"The Worst Nightmare of an IBS Sufferer: Don't worry, you WILL laugh at me, and it is okay. Part of my coping is my ability to laugh at some of the unfortunate incidences associated with IBS.  My boyfriend and I went on our weekly date night. I knew something was brewing when we sat down, and like a true IBS sufferer in denial, tried to ignore it and enjoyed my salad. Once the food came, I lovelingly looked @ my bf and announced, I have to go...NOW. He knew exactly what this meant, and continued to enjoy his steak.  Ok, it is bad enough to have an IBS attack at home, but we all know we pray on the way to a public bathroom that it will be vacant and we can be alone in our misery. Upon entering, I greeted the sweet hostess who sat us as she changed the paper towel roll....(be right back, another attack coming on...)  Whew, I made it. Back to the story from hell. As I pre-washed my hands as an excuse to bide time, hoping for her to leave me in peace, I contemplated which of the three stalls I would pollute. I picked the middle. After holding it for as long as I could stand, and realizing that the sweet hostess was now my nemesis of invasion, I let it go, flushing as a courtesy. Now bent over with cramping, I heard the door to the bathroom open. To my horror, a new stranger entered the 1st stall next to me, triggering another IBS attack. This time, with the hopes that the courtesy flush would work, it backfired. The complete sickness of awareness that the toilet was overflowing hit me, followed by a growl of noooo, as I watched my IBS flow all over the floor and into the room of strangers. I yelled to the hostess, Oh God, Emergency! In my efforts to escape, I panicked and did not realize that my pants were still around my ankles as I bumped into the hostess on my way to the empty stall next to me.  My thoughts drifted to my boyfriend, enjoying his steak with a ""WTF"" look on his face. The vision was interrupted by the hostess dry heaving as she attempted to plunge the toilet I had just left, which in turn, overflowed more, flooding the entire bathroom. Her cries of despair will haunt me for the rest of my life (and hers, I'm sure).  After washing my hands over and over, head hung low as the poor hostess cleaned up my attack, I rushed back to the table where my boyfriend had just about finished his dinner. He smiled and laughed along with me as I retold the horror. We quietly asked for a to-go box and left.  All of us with IBS take a risk when we enter the public, and it is what it is. I have developed a sense of humor and humility about this crazy roller-coaster of an illness, and have found that most people are understanding and helpful. Remember, everyone poops...some of us at inconvenient times. :)  Comment  Best comment ever! This is the type of attitude I have regarding this nightmare as well.

He literally died from having chronic diarrhea for over 15 years which led to wasting sundrome, malabsorbtion syndrome. He also was diagnosed with Pancreatitus, Diabetes Type 1, Hyperthyroidism, COPD, Congestrive heart failure, ( he had 3 stents), SMA syndrome, anemia, bouts of ketoacidosis and gastroparesis. His symptoms began in the late 80's with the symptoms of Diabetes, drinking large amounts of pop even during the night, and eliminating after every meal, and bouts of extreme anger because of severe stomach pain. In the 90's , he had 2 heart attacks a month apart and 2 stents were put in but he never mentioned his other symptoms to the Dr.(too proud). As time went on he would have increasing bouts of stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea daily. Was finally diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes in 2005 and hyperthyroidism in 2008 but nothing stopped the diarrhea which by now was so bad he was going 20-25 times a day, and also had vomiting. Since 2005 had been hospitalized over 30 times because of complications with dehydration etc.. from the vomiting and diarrhea. Since July of 2012, (when they diagnosed with SMA syndrome and installed a peg tube in his stomach for nutrition , and were able to manually remove the blockage and the vomiting finally stopped but diarrhea continued. Also had a J tube put in his stomach in January instead of the peg tube) has been in and out of the hospitals and nursing homes. He was put into Hospice in late May of this year and was allowed to go home, where he finally succumbed to whatever this is. He endured a constant nightmare of test after test with perios of being NPO, (nothing per oral) for weeks and months at a time, was constantly hungry because he was starving to death. His bowel movements smelled like vomit at times and were a dark green color where you could actually see his pills, food etc.. It's as if nothing was being broken down and was just rushing through his body. We even took him to U of M twice and they couldn't figure out what was causing it. We were getting ready to take him to the Cleveland Clinic on that Wednesday but he died that Monday. Too late at that point! I have all his health records and test results and am willing to give them to any health organiztion or Dr. for study to possibly find a diagnosis because our 23 year old daughter is now beginning to show some of these symptoms and we're beginning to panic!",,stomach,vomiting,syndrome,diabetes,exam,health,peg,doctor,doctor,pain

My husband really doesn't understand what it's like to feel this way and because we met originally as ""foodies,"" enjoying gourmet meals all over the country on business, he feels that I should continue to eat with him at every meal, and exactly how he is eating.

By dinner, I have to say ""I can't eat any dinner.""

I had caught the regular flu bug but it was different it also had a pain that I could never describe. After I had gotten over this flu that's when the acid reflex started. It was off and on for many years then it got to the point that it was everyday. I was about 15 when I started having it every day to the point were I'd be curled up balling my eyes out and nothing would work. Finally I started getting tested on. The tests were not very fun some of them triggered the pain. Finally when I was 16 or 17 I got diagnosed with GERD. They put me on pills right away. The meds did help but I was really upset because I couldn't eat my favourite foods anymore. The meds only helped as long as I didn't eat anything acidic. Now today I am 18 and I've been suffering with this for my whole teen years and going into my adult hood. It's not fun I can tell you that. But when I'm feeling down because I can't have say spaghetti with my family. I just remember that I'm strong and you can always modify your food with a different sauce or different flavour that's not gonna trigger the pain. And for people who say stop exaggerating well I always ask them could u imagine everytime you eat having a burning sensation or feeling like your gonna vomit. If not then you can't say a word about weather I'm exaggerating or not. I know another thing that gets me is the breath you get from the acid comming up all the time. Celery is suppose to help with that. It has helped me. It's not going to take it away completely but it limits it down. It's much better then having to brush your teeth every five minutes because you have a bad taste in your mouth or bad breath from the amout of acid. It does help a lot knowing that there is others out there who understand what I'm talking about. And acid reflex is not GERD. Acid reflex is a symptom of GERD. Don't ever get confused with that cause I've had people who just get normal heartburn or acid reflex from eating to much one day or something tell me it's not as bad as I describe it. It's is deffinetly not the same. And I hope one day that they can find a cure because its not fun to live with as with any other deceases. This site is good it makes me feel better knowing I can share my story with people who understand.,,acid,pain,people,flu,plug,food,tale,parent,mouth,tooth
696,"I am a female who has been suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome for 35 plus years. In the last two years my symptoms have gotten much more severe. I started having stomach problems at age 14. By the time I reached my mid twenties, the IBS had a major stronghold on me. I have had several tests to rule out cancer. Now I am in my late middle years with the IBS still plaguing me. I have no quality of life, because I am afraid to leave my house. I am afraid I won't be able to find a bathroom quick enough. The symptoms are so severe that I have wanted to die. Here is a list of my symptoms:  Extreme cramping in my lower abdomen, right under my naval. Cramping so bad that I feel faint. Trembling, shaking, sweating, hyper salivation that leads to nausea. heart palpitations,slight dizziness, cold and hot feeling. Rapid bowel evacuation, diarrhea, sometimes constipation. These precede a bowel movement. After BM, there is a feeling of faintness and some weakness. This last for about an hour or less.There is no visible blood in my stools. My doctor has checked for blood. There are no parasites noted as well. There is a dread of going to the bathroom, because I know how much I will suffer. I also have GERD. I am taking Zantac for the GERD. My doctor has ordered a medication for the IBS, that I have not picked up from the pharmacy as of yet. My stomach feels like it has a volcano inside of it. There is a very unsettling feeling in my tummy as well. Life is no longer fun, and I wonder how much longer I can endure this horrible suffering. At least I know that I am not alone in my intense suffering. My heart goes out to every IBS sufferer out there. Please let me know what has worked for you. I would greatly appreciate it.

697,"Im a college student, Im a female, Im 20 years old. I got IBS shortly after I delivered my first baby, before that I never had any problems. My sister also got it after her first child and she has it acting up again since shes pregnant again with her second child. My sister told me to take ""Culturelle Probiotics"", you can find it at Walmart and its like $18.00 for a month supply but it works! It replaces the bad bacteria in your digestive system with good bacteria. Before I started taking Culturelle I would wake up multiple times a night and several times a day with IBS attack. I was scared to go anywhere because I was afraid it hit me. Now I only get them if i eat the wrong foods. My child is 4 1/2 months old now and I still have random episodes especially if I eat something that triggers it. I havent figured out what all the foods that trigger mine are yet. Coffee is definitely something I cant take anymore. You have to figure out what foods trigger yours. You can google the common foods that usually trigger IBS to give you a start. Gassy foods like beans or juice, caffeine, etc. I only get like one attack a month if that now, I basically go without any, IBS is not a problem for me anymore. Culturelle is a life saver!

699,"My problem started about 2 1/2 years ago. I was at work and started feeling like I had a lump in my throat and could not breath. I also always feel bloated and have heartburn. (All tests for Peptic Ulcer, GERD negative) Sometimes the heartburn is so bad I feel like I'm having a heart attack. These episodes seem to come and go. I've been to multiple doctors who have not been able to help me. I've seen a larngeal specialist who told me I had some kind of virus (which she could not name) that affected my vagus nerve causing these symtpoms. She put me on Neurontin. Still not better. I've also seen ENT who referred me to GI. I'm currently seeing GI and have been on multiple medications but noone can tell me what is wrong with me. I could live with the lump in the throat and the heartburn but the not being able to breath is terrible. I have changed my life drastically because I never know when I am going to get these syptoms. I've tried to find something common that is happening or that I ate when episode occurs but I am unable to see a pattern.

700,"I was born with my problems. Doctors wanted to gve me a colostomy at birth. My parents said no. I had chronic pain always. Sometimes I could eat and sometimes I couldn't. I never had normal bowel movements. When I was able to go, it was like little rabbit pellets. I had to strain to get that out. That happened after weeks of producing nothing. When I became an adult, I got a gastrointerologist. He worked with me for 12 years. Finaly he got me a surgeon. I was in my thirties by this time. I had to go thru some tests before he operated. I removed all of my colon except for one foot. He reattached that one foot to my rectum. Oh, and by the way, I was working full time and raising children thru all of this. When I healed, I couldn't beleive that I was actually having bowell movements like everybody else. It was a miracle to me. Well, that surgery lasted about twelve years. The pain and constipation was coming back. That one foot of colon wasn't working properly--again. Still working full time, children grown and on their own, I got sicker and sicker and the pain became excrutiating. My GI dr. admmitted me to the hospital straight from my job. Did I neglect to mention that I worked in this hospital? Sorry. I was a surgery-pre-op lab tech. That day I was working in Outpatient surgery, so after my GI Doc came out of doing his procedures, he took one look at me and ordered an IV and pain meds, and admitted me to the hospital. I was put on TPN, lipids, and oxycontin. After my stay there, I was sent home on TPN. I took care of my own feedings, and blood work, since my picc line had ports long enough for me to reach. I was off work for a few months with that. When I went back to work, full time, My byfreind and I tried to find a specialist who would perform an illeal pullthrough so I wouldn't have to have a bag. After two and a half years and seventeen different specialists, I finally found a surgeon willing to do the surgery. He is in San Francisco. I was working the late shift in outpatient surgery with my supervisor, when my surgeon himself called me and asked if I could be there for surgery in the next two days. My supervisor, (knowing what I had been and still was going through) got really angry and said that this was an elective surgery. So I said that I elected not to have my intestine blow up. I went to San Francisco and had the surgery. With my first surgery, I was back to work in six weeks. With the illeal pullthrough, I was also back to work in six weeks. Mind you, I wasn't taking any kind of pain killers anymore. Pain killers actually slow down the already to slow intestines. Well, I was pain free for about ten years. This time i was referred to an upper GI specialist, (at the same hospital in San Fran), who did tons of tests on me. My diagnosis is this; neuropathic pseudo obstruction, constipation with pelvic floor dyssynergia dyspahsia, nutcracker esophagus, spasm esophagus. Now my whole GI system is being looked at. I had already lost my gallbladder. That was working at four percent. Now we're in 2011. My small intestine, since that's all I have, is giving me trouble. By now I'm 56 yrs old. I had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital that I worked at for 23 yrs and had been let go because I was making it such a hardship on my co-workers for being sick. Hmm. Anyhow, I was taken in for emergency surgery for an obstruction. It wasn't a food related obstruction either. I was told by my surgeon that my whole small intestine was covered in scar tissue, and that was what caused my obstruction. He also said he took down all the scar tissue. After eight days of doing well, I got released and went home. I was home for 24 hours when I started throwing up uncontrollably again. Oh, and I want to add that my boyfreind and my daughter were by my side for tis whole ordeal. They never left me. Ok, so my boyfreind called my surgeon and I was a direct admit. I was taken into emergency surgery again. I was in for six hours. I went to intensive care for 24 hours. They had given me blood during surgery and afterwards. I got about 7 units of blood in total. Well, this obstruction was a cluster of scar tissue at the opposite end of my small intestine. He ended up removing two pieces of my intestine. When I was able to go to the floor, I was sitting on the camode when I sprung a leak. A big leak. It was shooting out from between my staples. I was being drenched in bile. I yelled for a nurse untill I finally got a few of them at once. My call button wasn't within my reach. They immediatly helped me and called my surgeon, who removed some of the staples and put a urostomy bag over this fstula. Oh, did I forget to say that I had another picc line placed and that I was receiving TPN and lipids again? Sorry. Ok, I was in for about a month with these little problems. I kept running a low grade fever. Every once in a while it would spike to 101. Ok, I finally got to go home. Not for long because of this darned fever. I got admitted through ER. The next day my surgeon came in to talk to me. Some of my words were'nt coming out right. It wasn't even close to the word I was trying to say. Well, he sent me home again cuz he didn't think he could help me any better at the hospital than at home. Well my behavior was getting more and more odd. My boyfreind called my daughter and two more trips to ER and being sent home, the third time they kept me because this time I was critical. So the ER Doc, (there were others who took care of the rest of the pts.), cared for me and discovered that I was now septic. I almost died twice in front of my daughter and my boyfreind. I don't know how long I was out of it and I really don't want to know. When I finally did wake up, my eyes were so blurry I could barely see. And they hurt really bad. Well I had about four different DR'S this time. I had each of the hospitalists, (they worked one week at a time), who actually paid attention to what was going on with me. I had had a second picc line put in for the TPN. The Dr wanted to culture the tip of the first one. I ended up having a fungal blood infection. I was on medication for that as well. So, since I kept teling them about my eyes, they called my eye DR who checked me out and referred me to a retinologist. My boyfreind took me to the retinoligst and then brout me back to the hospital. The sepsis had gone into my eyes. The second visit to ten retinologist resulted in an injection in the worst eye to kill the germs faster. There was a germ in the center of my retina and all over my eyballs. One good thing was that my fistula stopped putting out bile for about two weeks, so the urostomy bag was removed. It was healing. Yay! Then I was taken off the TPN and the picc line removed. Things are looking up. The fistula had healed and there was about a half inch left to go. I finally got released from the hospital again, but not until there were no more germs left in my blood. I was in the hospital almost three full months. I had an appt.with the surgeon when I got out of the hospital. He put silver nitrate on the hole that was left from the fistula. Well, later that day, the fistula started putting out fluid again. ai thought it was still infected. Oh yeah, that was infected while I was inhouse and I was on antibiotics for that too. So, I got another round of antibiotics for the fistula. It continued to leak. My abdomin is also sore all the way around it, inside sore. I ended up going to the wound clinic where I saw a surgeon (I know all of them since I worked with them), who looked at it and said it wasn't infected anymore and it looked like some bile mixed with who knows what was coming out of the hole. He said he didn't want to put me thru another surgery to fix the fistula because he was afraid I wouldn't make it this time. So, he also said the fistula may never heal, but he was hoping it would. So, I am left with a leaking, stinky fistula and permanent damage in my right eye. Sorry that this is so long, but it's what happened to me. I don't know how long I have before I get another pseudo or scar tissue obstruction from this. Being in te hospital for three months has left me with a house going into foreclosure and a big gap in trying to get Social Security Disability. They denied me twice and said wasn't sick enough. I'd like to see them walk in my shoes for a day. No I wouldn't. I don't wish this on anybody, but it is my story and am sharing it with you.

702,"Hi there, thanks for reading this. I am a 20 year old woman who was diagnosed with IBS about three years ago, though I have suffered from it all my life and simply assumed that my weird bowel patterns were normal. As a little girl I'd dread sleepovers, or staying away from home, because the change in diet meant that I was either horribly constipated or had gas. This is still a fear I have now, but fortunately sleepovers aren't so much the norm as they were ten years ago! I am totally aware that in several ways, I am really fortunate with my IBS because I'm not incontinent, I don't live in fear of defecating myself, and my main problem is that I have a lot of gas and I bloat SO easily. But those- especially the latter- are two big problems for me, and I'm glad I found this forum where I can openly talk about it.  I'm a slim size 8, I work out every day and I work so so hard to keep a flat stomach. Except my stomach is flat for approximately five minutes per day, because as soon as I wake up I'll make a drink and BAM- hello bloated tummy. A piece of fruit or some toast later and I'll look about six months pregnant. By the end of the day, no matter how little I've eaten, I've gone up three dress sizes and I can't look at myself in the mirror. It's making me depressed because I spend my life feeling fat and frumpy.  When I was diagnosed, I was simply given a packet of peppermint pills that would, apparently, reduce the bloating. They did nothing to help, aided the gas problem a little, but the horrible bloated tummy remained and so I stopped taking them. Nothing works- I've tried everything- and some days I actually go without eating anything because I'd rather be hungry than want to cry whenever I see myself in the mirror. I've actually made myself sick a few times, in a desperate attempt to cut down the bloating (it didn't work).  Now this is the bit that's going to make me sound like a vain, narcissistic bimbo, so apologies if it comes across like that. I'm going on holiday next year with my girlfriends, and although I'm trying to be excited, I'm dreading my body in a bikini because I will look hideous. My friends are slim and don't bloat, and I don't think they'll understand me skipping meals for the sake of looking good in a bikini (understandable- they're my friends and they want the best for me). I've actually gone so far as to consider surgery, if there is any such procedure that could cure my abnormal bloating. I wouldn't ever normally think about something like this, but my bloating is more than the average 'food baby'- it's painful, it's horrible to look at, and it's affecting my mental health.  Could anyone out there empathise? Or recommend something to beat the bloat?Please help- I'm desperate :( xxx",,gas,stomach,friend,stomach,mental health,pregnant,baby,food,average,surgery

704,"Hello...I am a 49 year old female who has suffered from IBS-D since High School, so for a very long time! Over the years I have had many bad episodes and tried many diets, medications, talk therapy, you name it. My life got much worse when I had to have my Gallbladder removed. Talk about adding insult to injury...OMG! Now I have to take a medication an hour before every meal so my food won't go straight thru me! They work pretty good but not always. A couple years ago I found out that I had Uterine Cancer and I had to have a Radical Hysterectomy. I then found myself in full blown Menopause! I still have IBS, it's never going away, I just try to deal with it every single day. Thankfully, I married an absolutely wonderful man who is patient with me and understanding. Stress definitely brings it on, but it's just so awful when you're afraid to leave your house because you don't know what will happen or when or do I know where are all of the public restrooms are located along the way? I'm nervous to attend parties because I don't know what will be served or how many bathrooms that they have! I use to have a job where I waited on the Public and sometimes I would get ""the cramps, etc"" and have to leave my post and go to the restroom. Thankfully I never lost a job over my IBS, but it did make me late for work many times. Who needs to worry about this? I know...we do. (But it sucks.) Currently my Doctor has me on an anti-depressant Zoloft, which has and is helping for the ""anxiety"". I try to watch what I eat and I also take Immodium-D the night before or sometimes hours before a Big Event. It works for me, but then I'm constipated for a few days after. I'm hardly ever ""normal"" and when I am I'm always shocked by it and wonder how long it will last? Has anyone tried Probiotics? Do they work at all?

We are at no. 7 and my son is feeling amazing. After just one visit I saw a difference in him with improvements such as more confident and less stress of .wondering how he would feel as he woke up.

707,"I am a 38 year old male and I have been suffering from IBS since childhood. I'm not sure at exactly what age the symptoms started but I was not diagnosed until my early teen years. I must say that it has destroyed my life. As a child and teen, it was very hard socially dealing with the embarrassments of having to run to the bathroom multiple times while in school. We all know how cruel kids can be. In my younger years, I predominantly had IBS-D but usually it would clear up for the day after one or two bowel movements in the mornings. The stresses of knowing I might have ""to go"" at school just made it inevitable that I was going ""to go."" As I got older, I began experiencing more pain and more frequency (not just in the mornings). I made it through school but backed away from college because I didn't want to deal with the IBS through another 4 years. This in turn has led me to a job I really don't like but I have the freedoms of a bathroom at nearly any point I might need one. I don't do much socially because of fears of attacks, especially eating out. I joined the military out of high school in hopes that the rigorous, strict lifestyle would help. Actually, it did for the 14 weeks of training and I believe a lot had to do with the strict 3 meals a day, healthy meals, and a consistent daily routine. However, this was short lived, for once I was permanently stationed and went back on a less strict eating schedule, the symptoms returned. This led to leaving the military once my time was up because there were too many times I suffered trying to hold back bowel movements due to lack of bathrooms when one was needed. Today I still suffer from IBS-D, even though very occasionally I will get -C. Sometimes the pain, rumbling/gurgling, diarrhea, gas, flatulence, and bloating will go on for days. I will keep on my quest for finding a way to eleviate the symptoms until maybe one day a cure will be found. Let's hope.",,toilet,school,pain,meal,military,daily routine,plug,gas,short,lifestyle
708,"I started having pain and heartburn after eating certain foods and at one point went to the emergency room thinking I was having a heart attack when in fact it was my gall bladder. At age 40 I had my gall bladder removed. After that I started having abdominal pains and frequently (and suddenly!) having bouts of diarrhea. I wasn't sure what was causing it but over time I found that certain foods, fatty foods, caffeine and others were triggering these bouts. I''m writing this because of someone else's article that described the same thoughts, fears and anxieties that I have. I'm afraid I'll have an accident while flying, riding in a bus, coaching a game, long rides and it hinders my ability to date (divorced woman, age 45). I love good food and live about 30 minutes from the city, but can't manage the journey to go in and have dinner in fear I won't make the trip home! How would that be for a first date! My children and family understand but it's difficult to manage sometimes. I coach softball and literally don't eat all weekend because I can't take the chance of me having to run off the field to go the bathroom. Everywhere I go I always look for the bathroom first, just so I can relax and feel safe in knowing its not far away. One thing I have noticed is that mine comes in three's. When I have an episode, I usually go 3 times in a row, emptying my bowels. After the first one I stand in the bathroom waiting for the 2nd and 3rd wave of cramps, pain and diarrhea to come. It's not pretty and I don't like to talk about it. I'm not big on taking medicine but I did find that eating tums 30 minutes before I eat seems to coat my stomach (or something) and ""calms"" the acid or whatever it it that causes my body to react negatively to certain foods. I still haven't figured out all the food triggers either. I could be fine eating a salad one day and then the next not be fine. I have not been ""officially"" diagnosed with IBS but actually just made my first appointment with a GI doctor so I'm hoping he can give me some additional insight.

I tried balancing between laxatives, stool softners, enemas and immodium type meds.

They've thrown around ibs, celiac disease, stress and im scheduled for an endoscopy in a few days. I feel like im being bounced around and that they're just guessing. I hate this, I can't ho out with friends, work is hell most days. Im always tired, im scared of even having to eat. I resent having to eat some days I'll just drink those nutritional shakes to avoid dealing whith this. Im scared this will mean more surgery down the line.I just want to be normal.",,pain,surgery,celiac disease,plug,line,job,friend,endoscopy,exam,meal
713,"I am a 23 year old female. At the age of 13, I developed anorexia. My digestive system changed a little but by 21, after i had received help, I wanted to eat normally again, my digestive system didn't agree. It got progressively worse after a horrible bout with the stomach flu. 12 hours of puking and diarrhea and then low fevers and fatigue on and off for five weeks. After that my digestive system went from bad to worse.  Everything I ate bothered my stomach meaning I had horrible bloating, gas, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. I began having ""episodes"" and during those episodes it felt like someone was ringing out my intestines like a wet towel. I also had diarrhea and was incredibly nauseous. My whole body got sweaty and hot and I had to take off all my clothes. During these episodes I wished I wasn't alive. These episodes became so frequent and the abdominal pain became so bad that I was forced to stop working, postpone grad school, and stop doing physical activities. I didn't want to leave the house and I had HORRIBLE anxiety being in cars because several times I almost didn't make it to the bathroom. I would cry every day because I was so uncomfortable and miserable.  I finally saw a GI doctor and he talked to me for ten minutes and told me I had IBS and to go home and take fiber and probiotics and to come back in 8 months (not helpful). I called another GI doctor and at first he was great and said he would help me even if the tests didn't show anything. Test after test came back normal including colonoscopy and endoscopy. He told me he would have a plan to treat IBS and after finally getting ahold of him he told me he would prescribe an antidepressant. However, I had done plenty of research about IBS and antidepressants do not effectively treat IBS.  IBS is not idiopathic. I have read a lot about it in books such as Digestive Health with Real Food by Aglaee Jacob, M.S., R.D. There is also a very good article, "" 5 Simple Steps to Cure IBS without Drugs"" by Dr. Mark Hyman. After reading the article and sections on IBS in the book, I decided I want to actually treat the underlying causes of my IBS and contacted a naturopathic doctor who specializes in treating these underlying causes. I am now, after 3 months of pure and absolute HELL, finally being treated effectively. If you are in my situation, do not stop until you find a doctor who will treat you the way you want to be treated.  Don't let doctors just throw antidepressants and anti diarrhea drugs at you. Alternating between drugs is not the answer. IBS does have root causes that vary from person to person so I encourage you to find a doctor who will actually help treat your IBS. Be strong and do not stop until you are satisfied with your doctor and your treatment.",,doctor,doctor,system,antidepressant,drug,article,exam,book,article,pain

Diagnosed with gastroparesis five years ago, Stephanie is determined to live the best life possible – and to do her part to raise awareness and funds for this complicated disorder.  So she started the Annual Awareness Walk for Gastroparesis and Digestive Health. This year marked the 2nd year for the event. On September 7, 2013, Stephanie and her family and friends took to the trails in Bellingham, Washington, wearing their green awareness t-shirts and spreading the word about why research for gastroparesis is so important.  Stephanie selected a local trail for her walk that starts at a downtown farmer’s market, giving her the opportunity to engage with even more people who might be out on a fall weekend. Volunteers manned an information table and shared stories with people that came by, letting them know about gastroparesis, the Digestive Health Alliance, and why research for digestive health is important. Stephanie also worked with local sponsors for silent auction items and participation packets for walkers and donors. And for the second year in a row, blue skies and sunshine rained down on her event, providing a beautiful backdrop on which to showcase all of her hard work.  Stephanie has a strong passion to make a difference for those living with gastroparesis. Since beginning her journey, her efforts have resulted in more than $15,000 in donations for gastroparesis research through DHA and IFFGD. She’s also sold nearly 200 special Awareness Walk t-shirts, which her supporters can wear all year to raise awareness for her special event and the purpose behind it. Stephanie also hopes to expand the Awareness Walk and inspire others to host walks across the country to raise much needed awareness and funds for digestive health.

716,"I have been dealing with IBS-D for the last 10 years.My GI problems Started when i was a baby.I was lactose intolerant. During my teenage years I was diagnosed with GERD Then treated for that.It was in my late 20's when I started to pry for answers. I have found it very helpful to keep a food diary and try to avoid ""triggers"" daily Here is what has helped.   I have explained this disease to everyone I know.  I'm not ashamed to refuse foods during(family,friend,inlaw) dinners  Pro Biotic shots have helped with the cramping and have acted as a binding agent  Loperamide (eg, Imodium) is my best friend.It has allowed me to socialize and regain confidence that I will make it to the washroom on time.Above all it has reduced my anxiety.  Marijuana is the only thing that kills the pain.(Some may have an issue with this but I swear it reduces the smooth muscle spasm without the twisting, gut wrenching pain of antispasmodics)*  Do not give into the munchies associated with the pain relief of marijuana as it will only counteract  Antispasmodics did nothing for me  Mint tea helps reduce the bloating and gas  Be aware that dark teas can also cause D But as Im sure you've noticed you cant cure one symptom without causing another   Regular sleep schedules do wonders...Seriously GET YOUR REST :)  Stress reduction also does wonders  When I say wonders...I mean slight improvement.Im really trying to make the best out of it.   I refuse to let it control my life but I also try not to be so hard on myself because the fact is that I have a disease that consumes every damn day of my life.I do the best I can with what I know and I hope one day there will be a cure.Those who do not suffer with IBS do not understand the impact and stress that we deal with everyday. IBS-D has forced me to do some soul searching,to fight against my anxiety daily,to better manage my eating,sleeping etc and it has showed me who's real and who's not.  THERE IS HOPE  I wish for you all the strength and patience that this requires and to keep your head up.Try not to let it control you.You control it.Yes I know that's not always possible, I know that it's rarely the case but I promise that a change in thinking towards positive does help reduce anxiety and so does  Sleep and Loperamide xo",,anxiety,pain,food,disease,friend,stress,tea,agent,head,head
717,"I am a 36 year old female who was diagnosed with Gastroparesis two years ago while completing my final year of graduate school while working full time at a Fortune 500 company reporting to a Chief Executive.  During this time period, I experienced my body (and mind) completely collapsing.  I was unable to eat and when I did it I became incredibly ill.  There were also periods of days and weeks were I could barely get out of bed.  The stomach cramping and brain fog were terrible.  I’ve never experienced anything like it.  After several tests and months, I received the diagnosis of Gastroparesis.  FINALLY, there was a name for what I was going through.  Once I received my diagnosis, I immediately began doing research.  What was Gastroparesis?  Was there a cure?  Would I ever feel normal again? All sorts of questions began racing through my mind.  There is a tremendous amount of negativity floating around the internet in regards to Gastroparesis.  In spite of this, I was determined to keep fighting and searching for a better quality of life.  I am not one to take a challenge laying down and Gastroparesis was my new challenge to overcome.  After several months of living on smoothies a friend urged me to locate a massage therapist that specialized in chronic illness and digestive massage.  Thankfully I found one and her treatments were invaluable in the early days/months of my diagnosis.  An acupuncturist practiced at the same center, so I began to see him.  These two truly revolutionized my life.  I also began seeing a nutritionist and completely rehauled my diet.  After several months of my self-made treatment plan, I began to experience a turn around.  I was performing at a high level at work again.  I was able to exercise. I was able to eat solid food.  The change has truly been amazing.  Throughout all of this, I tried to maintain a positive attitude (easier said than done) and began to blog about my daily life with Gastroparesis at www.adventureswithgastroparesis.com .  I wanted others who were early in their diagnosis to find positivity and someone who could find the humor in what we deal with.  I also wanted a reference point for caretakers and friends, so that they could have insight into daily life with Gastroparesis.  I have now reached the point where I could complete my goal of running a half marathon ( Check out Geri's DHA Fundraiser for her Half Marathon - she exceeded her fundraising goal!!).  I may have Gastroparesis, but I have no complaints.  I have made some amazing friends that I would have never met otherwise!

718,"Since childhood i had some episodes of gastritis (diagnosed when i was a teen). It got much better when I went to college and got older. Still, I had occassional issues over the years, especially during times of high stress- and there has been much of that. About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with GERT, they said it was moderate, but i avoided all dairy except some cheese and had few symptoms. Four years ago i had an unknown food allergy- (bananas and avocados it turned out)that made me so ill i had an endoscopy. Then they said I had a fairly large hiatal hernia that may eventually need surgery and i told them I don't do surgery and pursued homeopathic and dietary solutions which have worked for me. Now at 61, I have been struggling with a sudden onset of something very akin to IBS. technically I'm not diagnosed as it's been a month and inconsistent- however, the bouts have been frequent and i have been very ill with it. I'm going for another endoscopy in a month and will find out what is going on then. In the meantime, I've continued reading blogs and on sites like this and have gotten very familiar with diet interventions that have shown great success. that is why i wanted to post. I found a plan called ""Great taste, no pain."" essentially it's based on science regarding how our digestive system works with different foods and the focus is on eating certain foods together- and avoiding certain combinations altogether. sound hard, but it's not. I implemented it and felt so much better I almost cancelled the endoscopy- but know better and didn't. I did fine at thanksgiving- and it just requires some planning. I have a family and a busy career and teens with some allergies, so I wondered if I could mange it all and I have. I only got tripped up when I ate a take out sandwich which combined bread (simple carb) with cheese and it started an issue. Also, i do have to be careful of allergies ans they can set this thing off and it's hard to twell what is causing the issue when i eat a wrong food. i will add that at 61, I take no medication, have always had excellent health and no allergies until older. However, gut issue cause more allergies due to autoimmune issues kicking in- so if you are young, turn this around with FOOD now.Hope this is helpful.",,food,allergy,endoscopy,cheese,surgery,blog,health,medication,bread,sandwich
719,"First off thanks to all of you that have shared your stories on here. Very nice to know that i'm not alone in all of this.  As for my story, I'm 29 years old. I was diagnosed with IBS following a colonoscopy back in 2003. In about 2006 i started having GERD like symptoms as well, which has only got much worse over the last couple of years. Looking back i know that this all started when i was about 14. Had my first real ""attack"" when i was 16. Out of no where i got severe stomach cramps and back pain all through out my left flank area followed by painful diarrhea. From that day forward life was never the same. I didn't go to a doctor with any of my symptoms for about 4 years since my first bad attack. I had never even heard of IBS at the time so i just thought what i was going through was normal as it didn't happen all that often over the first 4 years. When i was 19 everything started to get much worse. I was spending hours a day in the washroom sick with Diarrhea and feeling nauscious from the severe pain in my stomach which often brought me a grown man to tears it was so painful. I used to lay down on the bathroom floor instead of going back to bed just so i could be closer to the toilet. I used to get really anxious when an attack would come on. I would pretty much strip off all my clothes while sitting on the toilet. I'd have hot flashes, sweat, terrible stomach pain, every little noise seemed to really aggravate me while i was having an attack. I didn't want anyone to talk to me during an attack. I later was put on a series of meds from anti-spasmotic meds, pain meds, etc. At first the meds made things manageable but now they don't seem to work. I have lost several jobs because of my IBS. I've lost 25 pounds in the last 2 months which i believe could be signs that i have celiac disease so i'm waiting to see gastroenterologist. It has caused me to suffer from severe clinical depression for several years now so i'm also on anti-depressants. IBS has controlled my life and all the decisions i make in life. I have had to make many sacrafices. I know that living a ""normal"" life is not in the cards for me so all i can do now is try my best to manage the symptoms. Which as all of you know is much easier said than done. I find yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, going to the gym regularly has helped a lot and improved quality of life.  The hardest part for me believe it or not is not the IBS itself and all the pain that comes with it. It is that nobody understands what i'm going through. They don't take me seriously. When i miss several days work due to bad flare ups my friends and family think i'm just skipping work because i don't feel like going or because i'm depressed. It makes me feel so alone. IBS is a very serious life debilitating illness to go through. I just wish there was more i could do to raise awareness so all those who have suffered like i have could finally be taken seriously instead of being looked down upon and constantly questioned and doubted by your peers and family.  Thanks for reading everyone. You are not alone! Adam  Comment  I practice yoga usually two times a week and am an endurance athlete. I have terrible IBS meaning unexpected bouts of diarrhea and persistent gas. I found that during yoga i feel better but the folks next to me don't like it so much :( if you know what I mean.  Have to work at the back of the class near the door….  So might be something of interest to others who use yoga… take the gas- x before you go!",,attack,attack,attack,attack,pain,stomach,toilet,quality of life,job,family
720,I am a 30 year old female. I've been living with IBS since I was 12. Let's just say some days feel so long when dealing with this problem. I remember as a teen waking up every night with stomach cramps. That's how it all started. High school was a nightmare having to map out the closest route to a restroom and my mother having to talk to the principal and teachers to let them know I have to be able to leave the room at any time. Missing too many school days. College wasn't much better. Had to suck up pain through exams and long classes. I'm sure many of you had the same experiences. A few years back my gallbladder decided to say it was through with me and I felt better for a year then all the IBS symptoms returned with a vengeance. The past two years have been horrible. Chronic gastritis and gerd to go along with the IBS. My gastro wasn't any help. Prescribed proton pump inhibitors which made things worse. My reg doc is going to let me try Librax. I have heard good things about this drug. I hope it helps. Good Luck everyone!,,school,drug,.doc,pump,proton,gastritis,class,stratum,stratum,exam
721,"I'm a 26yr old male from Australia, with mainly dyspeptic symptoms of bloating and tightness in the stomach/upper abdominal area. It started a few years ago when I had very large meals I would noticed I get bloated and feel constipated afterwards. I attributed it to just eating too much. Since 2013 these symptoms came on more frequently and with just regular sized meals, primarily the bloating and a feeling of my stomach becoming really tight and heavy. In the past 6 months the feeling of tightness kind of just lingers around even hours between meals and its just a frustrating sensation to have to deal with constantly. It really puts me off going out with friends because I find it difficult to be ""in the moment"" when I'm consistently in discomfort. Nowadays I accept that is the case and I just go out when I'm not feeling so bad, and I don't feel guilty anymore for turning down events (well much less so).  Interestingly, I always read stories about people with dyspepsia having reflux and gastric pain but I don't have any pain whatsoever (thank god), but the discomfort/tightness is terrible. Anyone else have symptoms like mine?  I've had the usual upper/lower endoscopies with no findings, so the doctors just labelled me with functional dyspepsia to explain the bloating/stomach discomfort and IBS to explain the constipation. I've taken some prokinetics (motilium and reglan) but they didn't seem to do much. Although I've read some very promising studies regarding a drug called acotiamide that helps with the symptoms I have. I really encourage you guys to check it out on google if you're in my boat!  Anyway, I would love to hear stories from anyone out there who are sharing a similar experience to me.

723,"Hi. It all started with being fed cow's milk when I was a baby. I was constipated from that time on. In my family, we ate what is considered the American diet--meat, dairy, eggs, fruits, vegetables, processed foods, baked goods, white bread, and so on. I remained constipated while being potty trained and received repeated suppositories and enemas for a while and was traumatised by them. As I got older I slowly got better but it was not until I changed what I ate, then things really got better. I became a pure vegetarian and paid attention to combining foods. I ate whole grains, fruits and vegetables, plant proteins, etc. and that made all the difference in the world for me. Thanks.",,plant,fruit,vegetable,transformed food,world,cow,grain,food,bread,white

I was 16, going out for lunch with a bunch of friends, and suddenly I started to feel bloated, and couldn't control it I thought it was just because of the cold weather, but no it lasted for weeks and then months of pain and shame, i locked myself in my room, i skipped school 2 to 3 days per week,but then i decided to visit a doctor, that's when i was diagnosed with IBS instead of cutting off food that induced pain, i would turn to it as a shelter, as a friend, as a drug, and my IBS started to get worse and worse. I would cry myself to sleep at night, my friends turned their back on me, suddenly im there alone. I used this loneliness, this pain, this illness, to grow stronger, to conquer my fears, and to keep on hoping that this pain will someday leave. This loneliness made me rank the first in high school with a very high degree, this loneliness made me a strong girl that doesnt need anyone by her side, this pain made me realize that no one will help you get up except your will and your family.

726,"I began experiencing horrible IBS-D symptoms about five years ago. They came on so suddenly that within months, not only was I confused and embarrassed, but I developed a severe panic attack disorder. It took years to finally get a diagnoses after pleading with many doctors to take me seriously. Having this awful condition has completely crippled my life. I can not go anywhere where I can't get to a washroom with five or ten minutes which makes car rides, travelling, visiting friends, even getting to work or maintaining a relationship next to impossible. I've tried many antidepressants and anti anxiety treatments with no luck. However I do take lomotil daily and it has made a huge world of difference with most symptoms. I fall into depression quite often knowing I can't have a normal social life, can't drive anywhere, can't do anything really. Even the short train ride to work nearly kills me everyday. My symptoms got worse a couple years ago and I was diagnosed with agoraphobia. After almost a year of hardly leaving the house I realized that hardly eating, and I mean like a banana every second day, would calm my nerves enough to allow me to go out. I peacefully enjoyed a few months of a ""normal"" life until I got even more sick, caused from starvation. Now not only do I have IBS-D, a horrible panic attack disorder but also an eating disorder that's caused hemmoriods and ketones. I try to eat often now to battle the eating disorder and ketones but all it does is increase my anxiety. Knowing that I'm only 23 and can only leave the house if I'm wearing a diaper is really hard psychologically. This is an awful disorder, one I have not had the courage to open with others about. Im glad I have this website. It's given me a lot of strength when I've really needed it.

727,"I started having stomach issues when I started my first job out of college in 2011. It was a very stressful job in which I worked long hours and had a hectic drive to and from. The stomach problems started gradually. It would be upset a few days every month. This quickly grew to be an everyday occurrence. I had extreme difficulty getting out of bed in the morning because the pain was so intense. My boss started getting on me about being late. Then I started calling in sick on days because I was curled up on the bathroom floor unable to move. I had been to the doctor and had every test done. I had blood tests, a cat scan and a colonoscopy. Everything came back normal. I was on an antispasmodial medicine but I stopped taking it because I was throwing up. At work I wasn't always making it to the bathroom. I'd have to wash myself down and toss my underwear. It was really embarrassing.  Even though I'd read about diet changes online, I didn't know how to cook. So I bought a rice cooker and a George foreman grill. I literally ate chicken and rice for 2 months straight. I stopped going out with friends because I was afraid to drink or eat out. I was too embarrassed to tell them what was happening so eventually they stopped inviting me to things. My sister told me about a new type of treatment they were testing out in the hospitals. She is currently a med student. It was called a fecal matter transplant. And I said no way, not happening. Then my dad brought it up because he read about it in a Discovery magazine. I said only if I was dying.  Well eventually my condition got so bad that I couldn't move without being in pain, even with the diet changes. So with no plan in mind, I told my work I had to take an extended absence, which ended up being 2 weeks. My family talked me into having the procedure done. At that point I was so desperate I was willing to try anything. And within a couple weeks I actually started to feel better. I still maintained a simple diet but I felt my strength starting to return. I was still weak for quite some time though. To this day I still can't eat gluten, or drink much alcohol. But I rarely have the pain that I had then. As long as I make my own food I do fine.

Anyways, I have always been pretty regular. I never thought about going to the bathroom cause I never had a problem with it; man I miss those days. The beginning was so weird for me, I started eating healthy and exercising. I cut out soda, processed food, fast food and then suddenly I could not have a bowel movement for the life of me. I was under a lot of stress having getting declined from my first pick nursing school and getting over a bacterial infection. I tried everything under the sun to get regular. I chugged water and ate a lot of fiber **increasing my fiber made it worse**I tried hiding it from my parents and boyfriend but it got to the point where I couldn't anymore. I cried about it a lot at first but now I'm trying to remain positive and be proactive in treating IBS-C. At first I went to about 6 doctors and racked up some pretty hefty medical bills. It was disheartening I couldn't get any answers. Things started to get better and I started to have BM's every morning. However, I guess it has flared back up because these days i'm not so lucky. It sucks because everyone thinks i'm so healthy. I eat organic and exercise a lot. The truth is i'm constantly cramping, having gas, and worried about when will be the next time I poop? Another frustrating part is that I don't know what the heck to eat. I haven't been able to pinpoint what triggers my IBS. Wahhhh. Being a hypochondriac sucks because I know stress can amplify IBS. I have started yoga and try and de-stress when I can. However, stress is inevitable as a nursing student. My IBS came on so suddenly I am hoping it will leave suddenly to.

Now I am battling a spastic colon that my gastro doc says I may have. I went to his office last week due to the severe pain I was experiencing. Since I took 3 advil that early morning, he could not get a true examination picture of what was going on. I had pain in my lower lower abdomen, bloating, feeling gas throughout my abdomen. My doc has always recommended Miralax, in the past but I fought against it and preferred Psyllium husks. But since my water intake is not great, I no longer use the husks. My illness last week took 3-4 days to disappear.  Last night went out to a popular seafood restaurant (spouse & i have been eating there for over 5 years). I had a broiled lobster, red rice, salad, broccoli. This morning I woke up doubled over in pain again. These painful experiences has only happened to me about 2 times.  Was it the broccoli and the salad? I eat and love salads. Does anyone suffer from IBS due to constipation and IBS not due to constipation. I really do not want to visit the doctor again. I am wits end and find that only drinking ginger tea and rest helps.",,constipation,pain,salad,.doc,broccoli,tea,website,doctor,doctor,love
730,"When I was 18, I had bouts of extreme abdominal pain. The doctor said I had a nervous Stomach,That was 43 years ago. Over the years, it gradually became a cycle of constipation and bloating to diarrhea. Several years ago, I had emergency gall bladder surgery. During the time leading up to that, I had bouts of diarrhea with stomach cramps then I started vomiting every time I had the diarrhea and cramps. I thought this was all a part of the gall bladder problem. But now, I have the constipation/diarrhea/stomach cramps with vomiting every time I have the diarrhea cycle and the stomach cramps.

732,"I have been ill for exactly 1 year this month.  My problems started out of the blue, i fell ill one night and never got better. I had diarrhoea, stomach and back pains so bad I couldn't stand, nausea and couldn't eat anything for 6 days straight. After a week these eased a little, but have never stopped. It took a few trips to the docs to convince her it was more than just a stomach bug but after losing 2 stone to drop to 7 stone, she finally listened and I went through all the usual tests, blood, stool, the cameras etc but nothing was found.  I have tried all the diets with a dietician but none have worked ( I spent 5 weeks eating plain rice, tuna, potato and water and still had symptoms and bad turns). After one final trip to the GI doc last week I've been told I have IBS and that I may see some improvement in 2-3 years but I should expect to just have to learn to live with it.  I'm currently trying Amitriptyline to control the anxiety and symptoms (switching between violent IBS-D and IBS-C). I've been on it for 5 weeks and it's pretty awful if I'm honest, I have turned into a short fused, bloated, chunky Zombie. The side effects are outweighing any positive effects the drug may have if I continue, and the weight gain is awful so I think I may quit after this week.  I have lived on sites like these, taking in any info I can find on IBS, trying anything and everything I can to try to get back to my proper life, those times when I could eat foods I liked, sleep easily, had friends and wasn't so afraid to leave my house- it seems like that was all years ago.  I keep my IBS a complete secret, I'm ashamed of it and don't want the judgement and lack of understanding that other people have to offer. My partner knows and he has been amazingly supportive and understanding- especially when I can't leave the house or we have to cut trips short because I'm too anxious or ill to stay out. I can't tell my bosses at work because I don't think they'll understand, so I work through my bad days and just get called lazy or uncommunicative and surly because I don't have the energy to move or hold a decent conversation and I avoid making new friends because if I can't eat, go out, take trips or be good company then there really isn't any point.  It's a real shame there isn't more information about IBS given, all I learned and know has been taken from reading paper, blogs, diaries and snippets of web info. I also hate that more effort isn't put into understanding and treating IBS, it seems that once the diagnosis is given to a patient then that's it, you are told that nothing can be done so you are expected to shut up and put up.  I never thought about anything like this when I was well, but now I have complete sympathy, and empathy for anyone with any kind of digestive problem.

When i was very little i used to brag about having it. Now GERD is just a daily part of life. I take a pill twice a day, and I have a lot of stomach aches. sometimes it worries me when I hear about the heartburn because I always feel it in my stomach. (I am seeing a specialist about that next week) but my parents just say its because I am young, but I don't think that is why. I throw up after eating icecream and I don't eat before it.

735,"Hello all. I just want to say how relieving it is to have read some of your stories. Knowing there are people close to my age that suffer from the same disorder and daily things I have to deal with really is comforting. It shows I am not alone in this. I am a 23 year old female dealing with IBS.  First I was diagnosed with lactose intolerance in my second year of college. I was experiencing heavy stomach issues such as gas and diarrhea. Loose stool that lasted for about a month. I was worried so I went to the doctor and she suggested I eliminate dairy from my diet for about a month. So I did and I notice a big difference within about 2 weeks of no dairy. I then introduced it back into my diet and that's when I knew I was definitely intolerant. Unfortunately I am very intolerant, to the point where even lactose pills won't do anything for me. So I have chose to eliminate dairy out of my diet completely.  After that was resolved I thought it would be over and controlled but then in my last year of college is when the stress really began. I started experiencing ""attacks"" where I would literally have to go to a bathroom within the next 5 to 10 minutes or I would be soiling my pants. It was quite unfortunate and scary to say the least. After experiencing similar symptoms to lactose without having any dairy I got concerned. It was then I was diagnosed with IBS. For the first couple of months I had no control over it. It seemed to have a mind of its own but I noticed it popped up when my nerves were out of whack. Even if they were good nerves. It was hard to deal with, I never told anyone about it because I always hated discussing such private matters. Except with my siblings and best friend because, well, you can joke around like that lol.  It's been about 2 years I have been dealing with this and I have found ways to adjust. I take Imodium extra strength which I found really helps with gas and diarrhea. Although you aren't suppose to take it too often as it can leave you constipated, but I have quite the opposite problem so I'm usually okay. It's sad that I actual calm down after knowing I took a pill. Knowing that I have help to control a sudden attack. Living that way isn't fun. I stopped eating as much and go as far as to not eat breakfast until I know I will be by a bathroom. Food has become less and less appealing because I know it can go straight through me. But this leads me to my story which hopefully can help someone.  This has happened to me twice. I was in a situation where I had no bathroom access for a long period of time. I got nervous. Just knowing I won't be near one usually triggers it. So you can guess that it started to flare up and I knew I would need to go to the bathroom very soon. That sent my body into a panic attack. The shakes, the teary eyes the worry of embarrassing myself in public. The first time this happened is when it started. I would talk to myself. No joke I was in my car alone and I was talking to myself. I told myself ""don't worry. Don't panic, it's going to be okay. You will find a bathroom very soon and it will all be over. Come on stomach I know you can hold on just a little bit longer for me. I will stay in the bathroom as long as you want if you can just side with me here. "" yeah. I thought I was crazy but at this point I was willing to try anything to calm myself down so I didn't soil my pants. I started to do this a couple of times when I got to that point. And you know what? It started to work. It at least helps me delay it. I even started to accept the fact that hey, if one day I do end up crapping my pants in public then that's okay. S*it happens. Literally. And I will be super embarrassed but I will get over it. I know that I deal with a lot and if they knew too then they wouldn't be disgusted or weirded out. It was when I started to accept this condition that I found I could control it more. Deal with it even. It helps to find a partner who accepts you for who you are and understand what you are going through is difficult and uncomfortable. I find if you show that you don't care what people think, you deal with what you have to because you can't change it then they seem to back off a little more. To leave you alone and not question why you are taking 15 minutes in the bathroom.  This is just how I have dealt with it. I still have bad days, I still cry while sitting on a toilet feeling like I'm getting stabbed in the gut, but I'm happy. I know what I have and I deal with it. I find every way possible to not let it control me. I hope my story can help someone or make you laugh. It's okay if I sound a bit crazy too, because who isn't really :P.

736,"I've came across this website by doing research on the symptoms and issues I've been having.  A couple of years ago, I started to have bouts of constipation.  I didn 't think much of it.  I would just treat the symptoms with a laxative as needed.  Then over the past year, it's gotten a lot worse.  It doesn't seem to matter what I ate, I would balloon up like I'm about 9 months pregnant.  I'm a petite person, I eat healthy, unprocessed food and exercise several times a week.  The pressure of how big my stomach gets makes it uncomfortable to sit.  People dismiss me...they say, ""eat some fiber, drink coffee.."" but nothing works.  Finally I seen a GI specialist and told me it was IBS, and there is basically nothing they can do for it.  I haven't had a BM in days.  It is so depressing because none of my clothes fit.  I want to look professional at my job and it seems the only clothes that I can wear make me feel dumpy.  I get to the point I don't want to go anywhere.  When I wake up with a flat stomach, all I can do is think all day how I can keep from bloating up so I can wear something nice.   I'm afraid to even eat anymore.",,garment,stomach,people,plug,job,professional,depressing,expert,coffee,beverage
737,"I started having symptoms of GERD when I was 15 years old. I am 16 now. Last summer, all I would eat was frozen pizza and processed foods, my weight was average for a teenager so I never really worried about gaining weight from eating poorly. Suddenly, every morning was terrible for me. As soon as I'd wake up, I'd cough and gag almost to the point where I was throwing up and I had heart burn after/during eating. It has also gotten to the point where I don't like eating. I haven't had pizza in a year because I know my consequences.. Sometimes I wish that I could eat like a normal human being and not have a bad taste in my mouth from the acid reflux, even after brushing my teeth and ""I'm too young to have heartburn,"" I kept thinking.. So I asked my grandmother, who is a doctor, what was wrong with me and she told me that I might have GERD. I think I have gotten this genetically because my grandfather complained all the time about having heartburn. I was tired of fighting through the pain after trying to enjoy my favorite foods, so I've started eating healthier and exercising every day. I've lost about 10 pounds and I've started taking medication that was prescribed to me by my grandmother. I have researched this disease online and I now know how to live with it. Even though my friends don't understand what I'm going through and don't get it when I don't want to go to lunch with them because they're going to a fast food restaurant, I try to stay positive. My symptoms have gotten easier to deal with, but I still strongly dislike that I have acid reflux after eating because I'm a teenager and should be able to eat whatever I want, right? Well, I've discovered that eating healthier is better for me and even though I can't eat what I want to anymore, I know it's better for me.

741,"When I was in second grade in 1995 I started to have stomach issues. I was never a very large child and didn't have any weight that I could afford to lose. Over several months I lost so much weight I almost had to be hospitalized. All I knew was every time I ate I felt so sick- so I'd eat just a bite or two and stop. My mother was pushing my pediatrician for answers. His response after switching me to a lactose free diet (which didn't make a difference) was that it was all my head. I also endured a barium x-ray of my GI tract. I remember the technician telling me I did better than most adults.  Finally, my mother finally got me in to see a GI doctor. My pediatrician had been balking on giving us the necessary referral for insurance to cover the visit. When I finally saw the specialist he had a diagnosis within 5 minutes after listening to everything my mother told him. He put me on medication and I also had an upper GI endoscopy done to confirm the diagnosis. My diet became very limited. All citrus and other acidic foods were cut out, so no spaghetti with red sauce, oranges, pizza, etc. I wasn't allowed to have anything spicy, so no more tacos. Anything with caffeine was cut out of my diet, so no chocolate or soda, etc. The list of what I could eat was much shorter than the list of what I couldn't eat. This made birthday parties especially hard, although everyone tried to accommodate me as best they could (breadsticks instead of pizza, they tried to have vanilla ice cream for me, etc.). We also raised the head of my bed in addition to restricting my diet and prescription medication.  I was diagnosed before acid reflux was all over the TV and something that was talked about. It was before we had the PPIs that are available now. I was put on liquid Zantac (ranitidine) and Propulsid in addition to OTC medications, such as liquid Mylanta. Propulsid actually ended up being recalled for causing fatal heart arrhythmia in some patients. The ranitidine was foul tasting and is known as being one of the worst tasting liquid medications out there. In fact a nurse was really surprised when she asked my mother how easily I took it and my mother replied that I took it without any issues. My mother says that goes to show just how sick I felt that I would take nasty liquid medications without a fuss as I knew I would feel better. I had to take the medications three times a day, so while I was in school that meant a trip down to the nurse to take it. It also complicated sleepovers, so we tended to have them at my house.  We eventually got it under control, but then it flared up again from stress when we had a major move to a new state. We got it under control again and I was fine for many years. It flared up again in my senior year of high school, even though I was excited and not stressed about graduation and college. I've been on PPIs since 2006. I'm hoping in the future that I might be able to get off PPIs and have a more permanent fix.",,medication,mother,diet,ice cream,nurse,pizza,diagnosis,tasting,liquid,weight
742,"I have suffered from nausea and stomach aches my entire life. But I did not tell anyone about it until 2008. My parents were aware of these symptoms, but it is difficult to really figure out what's wrong with you when you're just a child. I was terrified about telling them, because I had heard stories about people having gastroscopy (I had never been to the hospital before). But it was awful living this way, not knowing what was wrong with me. In the beginning I thought everyone had these issues, because I haven't gone through a whole day without nausea. I had the gastroscopy in 2009, and I was convinced - this wasn't normal at all. The doctors diagnosed me with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. My esophagus was full of inflammation, and the doctors discovered something else: my case is chronic. I was actually born with this disease. They immediately gave me different types of medicines to get rid of the inflammation and the acid. I have lived with this hell since I was born, which is more than 18 years now. I often feel like giving up on everything because of all the pain, but I still have hopes and dreams for the future. A few years ago I told myself not to give up, 'cause if I do, GERD will win. It is a constant battle, but I will not kneel for this evil thing inside of me! It has caused so many problems in my life, such as weight loss and trouble eating (not an eating disorder).

748,"I am now 61 and have suffered with chronic constipation for over 20 years. I've managed over the years but as of 10 years ago, I've used psyillium, miralax, and milk of magnesia as a laxative. Over the past year I've noticed that my bowel habits have changed. I complained to my Gastro doc, but he always blamed it on the wrong foods I ate since I had previous trouble with GERD. When I came into office in March 2014, doubled over in pain in my lower pelvis, he wanted to blame it on gyn issues, but after he ordered a cat scan he then diagnosed me with IBS. My current symptoms include passing gas, bloating, constipation and sometimes diarrhea. Because of my profession, I need and love coffee and a glass of wine per day. I have read that coffee and wine causes IBS flareups, but I cannot live with out it. Most times the coffee and wine do not affect me, but there are small instances when they do. Another fault I have is not drinking enough water. I am trying to work on this problem since this definitely contributes to my constipation. I am not disciplined in taking my Miralax and or Psyllium as I should and the constipation occurs. Comment I know that you Love your coffee and wine but if they can hurt you I do Not understand why you would still drink them. I have serious pain in my abdomen and I would give up Anything if it will help the pain ease up or go away. Seriously,Anything.

750,"I have suffered with fecal urgency and incontinence since the birth of my daughter in May 2012. I'm 33 years old. I feel like I am carrying a huge weight around with me, everyday is so mentally exhausting. Everything has to be controlled and revolve around me possibly needing to use the bathroom. Some days I have 2-3 minutes to get there other days it's seconds. I suffer from anxiety and take medication for this. My life was so carefree before. I didn't worry or panic about going to places, I just got ready and off I went. Some days I feel ok, like I can go food shopping, or to the park with my daughter. Others it's just hard work. But it shouldn't be a battle just to go to the shops, or swimming, or go out for lunch. It never used to be. I don't think I've accepted it yet. It's like I'm me, Lindsay, but then I'm Lindsay who can't go out or can't do this or that. I have been off work since June. I can't see me being able to go back to my job. My career feels like it's over. But then strangely at the same time I'm happy? If I'm in control and left to my own routine etc life is good. Maybe it's the medication. I dont go the gym anymore, go running, out socialising with friends, go off out into the countryside like I used to but I am still happy. I am grateful for my daughter (it was a difficult birth and she was very poorly) she makes me smile everyday. I worry about me holding her back, her not being as sociable as she could be. I'm trying my best but I do worry it's not good enough. One day is like to wake up and not worry about having an accident. Just not to think about going to the toilet like most people do.

751,"I never thought I would consider going onto google and typing in: ""stories about constipation"", reading about these stories, and then feeling inclined to post my own. And yet, here I am. This topic is taboo for our culture, and after reading some of the other stories, this needs to stop. This is a symptom/disease or however you would like to refer to it that needs to be addressed, discussed, tested, and solved once and for all. I too, feel guilt for saying that something that is not ""fatal"" should be given more attention to when cancer is the #1 killer in our world, but isn't cancer commonly associated to all of the digestive problems that we are having? Just because we do not have cancer does not mean we are dying inside on a daily basis. I am 23 years old and have never felt so unmotivated and depressed in my entire life. I know most of you are saying ""Oh hunny, wait til your my age"", but most of you can think back to your early twenties where life is supposed to be full of curiosities, questions, and uncertainties, and yet, I hate every second of it. In addition to attempting to start my career and establish myself as a single, broke, and bored citizen, I am also trying to cope with my inner self every moment of the day. All of the stories that discuss diagnosis at an early age, counseling/nutrition/gastroenterology appointments blah blah are all prominent here as well. It is a waiting game, but what exactly am I waiting for? After reading all of your stories it seems to me that know one has come out to say: ""I found a cure!"" or ""This has helped me!"", so should I just simply say that this is the card I was dealt? Is this seriously going to be a part of my everyday life? How can you stay motivated? How can you function? How can you stay focused? My brain is warped, my emotions are too disgusting to even give detail to, my co-workers and loved ones probably can't even fatham being around me one more second, and most importantly, I have lost myself completely. This has nothing to do with my self-image or self-worth. I do care about myself and know that I am a beautiful and active human being but how on earth can this be true when I can't even picture getting out of bed another day and putting on a fake smile around everyone when I really want to scream: ""I HAVEN'T RELIEVED MYSELF IN 28 DAYS IT HURTS TO BREATHE! MUST BE NICE TO FEEL GOOD!""",,tale,cancer,constipation,culture,disease,world,uncertainty,citizen,diagnosis,nutrition
752,"Hello, My name is Susan and I am 52. About 3 1/2 years ago I started getting Really Bad Abdominal Pain. I also have IBS C but I never thought the Pain was due to that ailment and neither do Any of the Many Doctors I have gone to see. I had my Gallbladder out right away and that did Nothing for the pain. The Pain is actually on the right side mid abdomin. I also have Kidney Stones in both Kidneys and have had Four Surgeries for those removals in the past 3 1/2 years. Believe me I know the difference between Those Pains. At one point the pain,normally an '8' Every Single day, was a '10'. This day was a '10' and it was horrible. I have had natural childbirth, no drugs, and I Know what a '10' is. So I went to the ER and they said I had a  Severe UTI. Now, I had Never had a UTI in my life and I have NO other UTI Symptoms. After I take the Cipro, the pain does go back to an '8' which is Better than a '10' but is Awful! I can barely stand in a line at a store. I can't walk for any length of time. Nobody but Nobody can figure out this problem and I had to be qualified as 'disabled'.I can't work and I sleep 10-15 hours per day (was previously diagnosed as an 'Insomniac!')  This is Seriously no way to live. Any ideas would be Greatly Appreciated.To all who suffer from unbearable Pain, I Completely Understand. People don't believe me because they don't SEE the PAIN!!!

753,"At age 50 I had to say good-bye to a very diseased colon, but was encouraged when I learned about j-pouch surgery to create an ileoanal reservoir. This meant a life free of wearing and ileostomy bag -- which did have to wear for a year and did not get along with at all -- and I was excited. However, before I turned 51 I was found unable to continue working due to fecal incontinence, as it is pretty difficult to commute long distances by public transportation when you do not have ready access to a restroom, and your urgency can make or break your day. No employer wants to accommodate a day full of long trips to the restroom, reduced concentration, and uncontrollable interruptions! Without a colon to neutralize the stool you pass, any leak can lead to excruciating burns on your skin, so the order of the day, every day, is to avoid leaks and clean them up immediately if they occur. I can not use adult diapers because they cause horrible irritation, and no one make a pad that is adequate, comfortable, and gives the right amount of coverage for the issues I deal with! I have gradually had to give up all the activities I have enjoyed in my life: feature length films in theaters, backpacking trips, camping, kayaking, and even walks around the neighborhood have all become impossible due to incontinence. Even travel by car is frightening, because I live in an area plagued by impossible traffic issues. Travel to see my grandchildren is greatly impacted, as the 3-hour trip can become an excruciating exercise in pain and prayer that I make it to the next rest stop in time. I have even found it impossible to paint at my easel due to the fact that not only can I not concentrate when I am having urgency and frequency issues, but even a minute or two is enough time for paint to dry and become unworkable on the canvas.

Until now, I have recently been diagnosed with severe IBS triggered by an unknown virus, I may also have endemetriosis (I am waiting for the referral to gynae at the moment) and also have had underlying overactive bladder syndrome (which was mistakingly diagnosed over the years as UTIS). Unfortunately this unknown virus triggered acid reflux and persistent vomiting on a daily basis for months, lost a huge amount of weight (Low Bmi of 17) and couldn’t eat, apparently my gastro consultant confirmed that unfortunately this is something that can happen at the severe end of the scale for IBS which isn’t mentioned on this site and I suppose for good reason, if you’re vomiting you must see a doctor and must have the dreaded endoscopy and colonoscopy (I’ll be honest, they’re not as bad as they sound they’re going to be, infact for the endoscopy they spray you’re throat with a rather nice banana tasting anaesthetic) .

758,"I had just finished the electronics technician school for submarines in Groton,CT when I was diagnosed with diabetes. Not wanting to lose another submariner, especially a freshly trained one the doctor convinced me to stay in the Navy. I was in prime shape, running 10 miles a day and the doc told me if I keep working out, I had nothing to worry about and no further treatment was needed. Unfortunately, I have type one diabetes and require insulin which I did not receive in the Navy. This led to many complications. Food would rot in my gut and I threw up countless times daily. After 3 years, acid reflux had ulcerated my esophagus leading to multiple blood transfusions and a nissen surgery. I've had the nissen rewrapped 3 times the last 10 years. Not until my last surgery was I diagnosed with gastroparesis. During the last surgery two years ago, they also cut open the pyloris. I have been in pure hell ever since. Before the surgeries, I'd just throw up but eating didn't hurt. Now, I can't eat anything without extreme pain. In order to eat, I have to take high doses of pain medications.I haven't had a solid bowel movement in ten years. I feel ready to give up.

759,"In my early 40s I had episodes of stunning ""gas pains"" in my lower left gut which I later realized were episodes of diverticulitis. I also began to develop a tendency toward constipation, but never due to hard, dry stools. I also had a very serious lactose intolerance since childhood. The smallest amount of milk or yogurt in some sauce or other would leave me doubled over in pain. Throughout my life I was athletic and careful to maintain a good diet, heavy on fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains and got most of my proteins from beans and complex carbs. Never processed food. But often I would be bloated and my gut was full and heavy with a soft stool that would not move. And there was copious bleeding from the rectum. My doctor seemed skeptical that I was reporting accurately and told me to add more fiber. Although I was already eating about 35 grams a day of fiber in my diet, I added psyllium husk capsules because I couldn't add more dietary fiber without an increase in calories. I was now up to 50-60 grams of fiber and feeling gradually worse and worse. I began taking a laxative every day because as soon as the bowel emptied, the relief was enormous and the bleeding would stop. Over the next ten years I began to keep a food journal and to carefully document how I felt and what I had eaten every day. I changed doctors a couple of times, I had two colonoscopies and three hemorrhoid ligations. I spent three hellish months on Miralax - the worst I ever felt - and tried probiotics (several) and Amitiza, to no avail. When I found the FODMAP diet almost three years ago, I immediately felt better than I had in years. The previous GI didn't believe in it but the next one did, and that one also told me to cut fiber down. The new GI also refuted the previous one's claim that laxatives are dangerous and would eventually cause cancer. Over the course of three years I gradually cut dietary fiber back from 55g a day to less than 10g a day and I felt better and better. At less than 10g the bleeding stopped, the stools began to have some form and were much easier to pass. I was able cut my laxative use in half by cutting my fiber to a fraction. That is not supposed to happen. Over those years I had two bad episodes, which followed a high fiber intake. The first was a simple cucumber salad, the second was a handful of nuts. In both cases, I had been feeling great for weeks but then within two hours of eating the salad or nuts, I had the old familiar sensation that my guts had gone flaccid and distended and had fallen in a heavy, tender pile in my body cavity. Bleeding and gas began within two hours of eating and did not abate until after the next bowel movement. I don't know what's going on and clearly my doctor's don't either. But years of debilitating symptoms were reversed by adopting a diet that is exactly the opposite of what is so widely recommended that it is considered common knowledge. I hope someday science will catch up and common knowledge will be replaced by real knowledge.",,science,diet,doctor,doctor,pain,salad,gram,gas,lactose intolerance,transformed food
760,"I am 29 years old and have been suffering IBS-D (sometimes C) since I was possibly 15 years old. I was officially diagnosed by my GI about 3 and a half years ago. Its good to know what it is, but sadly so devastating there is not alot that can be done. I useto have specific symptoms that would indicate a flare up, but as time goes on I find symptoms changing yearly. Right now I suffer from sharp painful cramping across the top, bottom and down left side of my stomach. Which in turn leads to explosive watery D as much as 5-7 times with 2 hours. It can happen so randomly like it comes straight out of nowhere to smack you right in the face! lately this has been happening during the middle of the day, whereas before at night or first thing in the morning. Sometimes I run to the bathroom within minutes of eating with no pain just urgency! I have tried cutting down my diet which had some effect after many weeks. I take Buscopan for the pain and Imodium for the D. In conjunction to this I suffer debilitating anxiety. I guess it makes sense that when i'm anxious I have more symptoms, but this isn't so every single time. Sometimes after a stressful situation I will get a flare up of IBS a few days later. Having both these conditions is like a death sentence some days... More anxiety = more IBS.... More IBS = more anxiety.

I go through phases where my pain and other symptoms it's unbearable, to times where it's tolerable. The worst symptom of all is the terrible abdominal bloating/cramping. (I look like 6mos+ pregnant) I can't wear any clothing that restricts my abdomen even slightly or I will be in agony. I haven't been able to wear jeans comfortably in almost 5yrs. I finally had to start wearing maternity jeans because I'm so sick of wearing nothing but tights, yoga and sweat pants.

Neither does increasing or decreasing my fibre intake. I started on a portion/calorie controlled diet several years back to lose weight, and hoped that maybe as a fringe benefit my IBS symptoms would decrease even a slight bit in severity, but no such luck. I've tried eliminating things from my diet one at a time (gluten, artificial sweeteners, dairy, etc), and each time most of the symptoms disappeared or lessened for 2 weeks, and then returned with a vengance (almost like clockwork - two weeks exactly each time!)

764,"Several years ago I began having episodes of fecal incontinence at night while asleep. Sometimes every few months or multiple times a week. I chalked it up to the frequent diarrhea I had been having since my gastric bypass in 2002. Then I began having minor spotting accidents during the day. I began taking extra clothes to work just in case and lived in fear of a ""big one at work"" I couldn't hide. Eventually, it got to the point that if I didn't make it to the bathroom at the first indication I had to go, I would mess myself either a little a sometimes a lot. When I started having accidents in bed, I bought a good mattress protector. However, I was exhausting the next day when I'd have an accident because I would have to change all my bedding and clean myself up. This might mean a full shower if my accident was bad enough. Try going back to sleep after a midnight shower. I rarely could. I was often exhausted from lack of a sleep the next day and this was affecting my work. I know many don't like to say this, but I began wearing adult diapers to bed every night because I never knew when I was going to have an accident or how bad. I was bed wetter until my early teens so the choice to wear diapers at night was not as hard for me as it might be for some since I had been in diapers for my bedwetting until my mid teens. Granted, back then the only option was cloth and plastic pants, not what I would choose for fecal incontinence. Even with my prior experience, I was very humiliated and felt a lot of guilt at first because I was an adult and adults shouldn't be wearing diapers. I must be lazy or less of a person because of my problem. It took me a long time to get over this type of conditioning and accept this was a disease and I did not ask for it, but I had to deal with. I was letting social norms dictate how I should feel and act. I was still too embarrassed to go to my doctor so I handled it on my own. It took much trial and error to find the brand and style of diaper that worked best for me. Thank god for so many reputable companies and their helpful staff. I know most just wanted to sell a product, but many seemed genuinely concerned and listened to my ""sob"" story with a sympathetic ear. However, when I realized I no longer had to worry about a mess spread all over the bed in case of a night time accident and have it neatly contained (yes neatly be a relative term), I could actually get a good nights sleep. My work improved and I had more energy during the day. My day daytime accidents were the same though. I never knew when, where or how bad they were going to be only that they were going happen sooner or later. I was still reluctant to wear a diaper in public for fear of discovery. I finally had a major accident in a public place (Wal-Mart) that was blatantly obvious and totally humiliating. I decided never again. Someone may or may not notice you are wearing a diaper, but a really bad accident in public will definitely be noticed. I chalk that up as one of the most humiliating experiences of my life. Anyone whose been there will understand. It did not happen overnight, but I gradually began wearing diapers all the time and I have been wearing them in one form or another for over 3 years. I have gotten to the point I can call them what they are, diapers. Not pads or fitted briefs or other euphemisms, I don't even say adult diapers anymore. I found that being matter of fact about what they are helped me get over the social stigma (mostly). When I started wearing them all the time, it was very difficult to accept and get used to. Wearing them at night was one thing, but in public and especially to work, quite another. I was always afraid someone would notice and say something. However, I learned that with proper a wardrobe, I could even hide my very thick nighttime diapers I had to wear during the daytime when my incontinence was at its worst. The hardest part was wearing them at work, but I even got used to that after sometime. I eventually found that as I got used to them I stopped constantly worrying about them being noticed. I also realized that even if I had a major accident, I could get to the bathroom and change before anyone noticed. When I realized all these things, I was able to gradually relax and focus on what I was doing, be it work shopping or what ever. I think this is about the time I realized I was in control, not my illness. This also helped my work performance and attendance. I did notify HR of my medical condition in case I had to leave work for a really bad accident, but fortunately I did not have to provide details. I just had advise them I had a management strategy and my condition would not place an undue hardship upon them. I realize most would choose diapers to manage this condition, but when you know it is a matter of when not if you are going to have a bowel accident, you do what you have to do and this works for me. I have since been to several doctors. Besides chronic diarrhea I have been diagnosed with mal-absorption syndrome and take vitamin shots on a weekly basis. This has greatly helped my fatigue as well, but done nothing for my incontinence. My doctor is still searching for a cause, but offers no answers so far. He has warned me I should be prepared to deal with this long term. I'm hopeful, but I think he was trying to tell there may be no easy answers or cure. I will not undergo invasive surgery nor will I live with a colostomy bag. The drugs I have tried may have reduced my incontinence but since they have not eliminated it, I will still always wear a diaper. Since the vitamin shots and sleeping through the night, I feel better than I have in years. I will never willing repeat the humiliating experience I had messing myself in public. Yes diapers are not what I want to wear everyday and it might not be the right choice for everyone, but they are non invasive and have few side effects. If a treatment is found, they can be easily removed, unlike most surgical treatments. They can be worn discreetly and with the internet, ordered discreetly. I find it helps to keep things in perspective. When I first started having this issue, I was terrified I had colon cancer, as cancer runs in my family. I was so relieved it wasn't cancer, I found I didn't care so much about my incontinence even as no cause could be found despite numerous tests. I look at some of the illnesses and diseases some of my friends and family have been forced to endure (and some passed away from) and I remind myself how lucky I really am. Even after all these years I am still embarrassed getting up in the morning in a messy diaper. I know I have to put a fresh one on ever morning or or risk having public accident at work or wherever I am that day. But it is just a style of underwear that allows me to keep my dignity. I mean it is just plastic and absorbent material, nothing more. I still hope for a cure because I would love to go swimming, wear shorts in the summer or do any number of other things I used to do. I never realized how hot even the thinnest diapers are. But I will not wallow in self pity, be a shut in or let my incontinence control me. If I have to wear diapers for the rest of my life so be it. I will control my life not my underwear or my illness. I urge everyone to remember this, is not an easy hand you have been dealt, but you can play it and persevere. Don't ever give up, YOU ARE IN CONTROL. However you handle your disease don't quit, don't give in, don't despair. I am using diapers to manage my illness. Don't let society and the stigma stop you from using them if they might be your best alternative. If it is not for you then there is an answer don't quit looking. You will find it and you you will over come. To quit is to die, so DO NOT QUIT! If you take anything at all from my story, that is it. DO QUIT. DO NOT GIVE IN. DO NOT GIVE UP. YOU WILL PERSEVERE.",,accident,job,accident at work,adult,long term,social norm,side effect,colon cancer,bed,disease
765,"Okay truly I don't know what I have aside from chronic constipation but there is a question mark in my medical notes for Hirschsprung's which is what i believe i may have. I am writing because i am a bit down about my condition at the moment. My childhood was affected by it... i grew up believing there was something wrong with me, not like i had a medical condition, but that i was just stupid in some regard... i would sometimes do these big bowel motions that would block the toilet, that was my main symptom as a child. I would also get slight staining in my underwear which was why i thought what the hell was wrong with me, why couldn't i control it? At high school it got pretty bad... i would make a lot of trips to do wees and every time had to wipe ahem... Sorry for my descriptive story... i had my first boyfriend at this stage and was paranoid about it now and also how i would go to wee and my friends would make comments about the smell of the toilet afterwards. One day it really hurt and finally it was the fact that the stool was hard and making me tear/bleed that got me to tell mum this wasnt normal and went to the doctors. I never knew i was constipated until the doctor told me. Never knew after a lifetime of it so far. Had a barium xray and basically just was told to use laxatives and that was that. There is one particular family member who knows i have this condition and yet doesnt get it. If i have gas when i am at her place she constantly says she thinks one of my kids has pooed and i go along with it and pretend they must have just farted but she never gets it no matter how many times i go over. Then there is people asking me if i am pregnant because i am always bloated... twice last month, once the month before, am always asked and it is depressing. I asked for a biopsy to check for hiershsprungs as its to the point if i have it i want surgery however have been put on some laxative pills now as ive said the medicine is disgusting and dont want it. I really wont live my life drinking that disgusting stuff every day. Comment It sounds like you have very bad constipation - but Hirschsprungs is usually dx in infancy or early childhood. Sounds like you need a helpful doctor! Comment There are people that make it into adulthood with hirshsprungs it is rare but some as old as 60 I met a young man who's mother was diagnosised at 40 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer so it is possible but finding a Dr.that will look into it is hard. My son was born with short segment hirshsprungs I have wondered if I had it but the Drs.won't check me.good luck to you.",,doctor,doctor,condition,infancy,people,medical,toilet,constipation,mother,comment
766,"I have always struggled with my weight, my doctor would constantly ask my parents if I showed any signs of anorexia, people would compliment me on how flat my stomach was or how skinny I was, but little did they know what I was dealing with on the inside. I was always able to eat anything I wanted without gaining any weight.I was hospitalized 8 times in the year leading up to my first year of high school, all I wanted was my life back again.  It all started when I made the courageous decision to walk to the bottom of Grand Canyon with my dad and two siblings. It wasn't until I had just reached the bottom where I started experiencing light headedness, dizziness and diarrhea. My dad was convinced I was just dehydrated and the altitude was taking a tole on me. I was only three miles from the top when it hit me. It was like the vomiting would never stop, I felt as if I would pass out any minute, I knew continuing would be at a disadvantage, so I had to be air lifted out of the Grand Canyon and taken to a hospital three hours away.  The doctors still had no clue what was wrong with me. I went through numerous tests including a colonoscopy, an endoscopy, stool sampling, gastric emptying, gall bladder sonogram, and an EEG of my stomach. After numerous antibiotics and prescriptions I was put on, I have been narrowed down to only taking a probiotic pill every night with dinner. Since my diagnosis, I've realized that it is hard to enjoy everyday activities without having a fear of throwing up.  Because of this I live everyday with the fear and the memory of the day I was diagnosed with GP. I am on a strict diet and reduce to consume any foods that bring back any reoccurring memories of that day.  Getting Gastroparesis at such a young age has taught me to always keep fighting. Discussing my illness with others makes me feel weak so I try to avoid that subject at all times, but hiding from the truth is just going to make things worse. I have Gastroparesis, there is nothing I can do about it but take my medications, keep my head held high and hope that every tomorrow brings me the courage to keep fighting my disease and not letting it define me.",,weight,doctor,doctor,weight,stomach,ass,father,antibiotic,disease,pill
767,"In early February 2014, I spent a week in the hospital and was eventually diagnosed with gastroparesis. My life changed in ways I could not have imagined – overnight. One day, I was able to eat at buffets, if I so desired, and the next day, I was unable to tolerate all foods and liquids. I was hospitalized with severe pain and vomiting, put through a battery of tests (including one particularly terrible one where they forced a tube down my nose and pumped my stomach), diagnosed, given only a brief explanation of my illness and its treatment, and sent home. For the next few weeks, I was on a liquids-only diet, and I was told that I had to gradually work my way up to soft foods and (eventually) solids. Unfortunately, nothing like that has occurred. I am able to eat some soft foods, in tiny amounts, but it is becoming clear to me that I will never again be able to eat “normal” foods in “normal” amounts. At first, I told myself that I would not let this stupid disease define or control me – it simply WOULD NOT be the center of my life. But as time passed, I began to see how foolish that was. Every single day, every second of every day, I think about food. I see it; I smell it; I cook it and feed it to the other members of my household; but I cannot have it myself. I look in the mirror, and I see a skeleton. I try to eat even small amounts of food, and I am in agony. I am weak and fatigued to levels I didn’t think were possible. Some mornings, I don’t think I have enough energy to get out of bed. I can barely concentrate and function enough to do everyday tasks. And almost every single night, my husband has to help me up the stairs to bed because he is afraid that if he doesn’t, I might fall down those stairs. My 10-year-old daughter has seen me vomiting, screaming in pain, lying on the floor crying, and on the verge of passing out. At times, it has frightened her so much that she has asked my husband to get me “Life-Alert” for the times when she cannot be home with me. I grieve over the fact that I can no longer travel or get out of the house for much of anything. I grieve over missing family events and not being able to attend my daughter’s activities. I grieve over not being able to go out to eat, or on a picnic, or to another concert, or any of the other things I know are not possible anymore. I worry that I will not get to see my daughter graduate, or get married, or have children. I am not on the verge of death today (at least, I don’t think I am), but when I look in the mirror and think about how tired I am, I realize that people like this do not have long life spans – and it bothers me. I get frustrated because people do not understand how my life is affected by all of this. If you were to see me on the street, you would likely not realize I am this sick. I don’t look that sick. And because most people are unaware of the effects of GP, they ask me all of the time if I am okay now. I can’t seem to convince them that I am never going to be okay again – not in the way they mean it. I am told that I “just need to eat,” or that if I would only try “Activia,” I would be okay. My own doctor (PCP) accused me of being an anorexic and told my husband to “watch me.” And though I know people mean well and are trying their best to help, it still makes me so frustrated. I am angry because I am a control freak, and I don’t like having to be a slave to this disease. I don’t like not being able to do things myself – always having to rely on others to do them or get help doing them. I have screamed at, smacked, and pushed my husband away for simply trying to help me more times than I can count. I have thrown things (including food) across the room in fits of anger. I have intentionally gone without eating – even though I know I shouldn’t – just to “show” this disease who is in control. Crazy, I know! I am angry because I do everything that I am supposed to do – eat the right things, exercise, and ingest the known medications – and I am still sick. I think about the others who have this disease who are so much worse than I am. There are hundreds (maybe thousands) of posts in my Facebook feed every day from people who have had to go to the ER or back in the hospital for dehydration, pain, or other such conditions. I know so many people now who have feeding tubes or ports for nutrition. I know many who have developed other serious conditions because of the GP. I sometimes look at them and think that this will surely be my future, too, and it scares me. There are times when I am in such agony that I can do nothing but cry – lie on the floor and beg God to just let me die. He doesn’t – and I am so thankful that He ignores those moments. I mostly have a good attitude about my situation and try to make the best of it. I am a Christian, and I believe there is much ahead after we leave this world. I also feel blessed that I have been given so many years with the best husband and daughter anyone could imagine. I am truly thankful for each day I get to spend with them. I do not understand why I have to have this disease, but God does, and I trust Him. What I do understand is that it is somehow important to me to let people know what I go through – what all GP sufferers likely go through. I am sharing these personal details in such a public forum because I think it is important for people to see this disease. But I think it is equally important to share how much I have been blessed BECAUSE OF this disease and to let others know how much they matter and how much of a difference they can make. I have received help from family members, friends, and acquaintances beyond measure. My neighbors have cooked meals for my husband and daughter; they have watched my child and my pets; they have offered to transport me to and from appointments; and they have done everything they can to suggest ideas (and foods!) that might be tolerable for me. My family has come to visit me, even though I know it is horribly inconvenient for them – and they have also stayed away when I have asked them to, even though I know they wanted to be here. I tell you, honestly, every single person I know has helped me in some way. Some have visited, some have called, some have done chores and tasks, and some have cheered me up with their stories. Don’t ever be convinced that you can do nothing to help or that you don’t matter. To those who are struggling, your efforts to understand, cheerful words, helpful attitude, and other contributions really can make a difference.",,food,people,disease,husband,family,home,pain,single person,long life,child
768,"Gastroparesis the beginning. I believe my journey began in 1989 with the first migraine, but I didn't realize it. The first migraine I had was a reaction to Indocin. I thought, at the time! And it may very well have been! What you also need to know? Is that I was an avid exerciser, biker, jogger, and really worked at being healthy. Always had sinus and constipation issues but did my best to get around those without slowing down and you would not see me near a doctors office~~ until it interfered with my life! Which one winter it did with pleurisy... My Dr just shook his head, when I said, "" I can't run... Because it hurts to breathe,!"" And he says, "" well yeah!"" One thing which might help to understand my personal tenacity? Is to know, I was hit straight in the driver's side door in 1990. I was leaving an observation of elementary school to then drive two hours for exams towards the end of a semester, to finish a degree in early childhood education! My car was totaled, my tooth knocked out, lower front jar broken, muscles pulled from back of my neck, and all I could think of was ""this is not! Happening right now! I am finishing this degree!"" I would get my mouth wired, go home, return to the hospital with concussion symptoms and AGGRAVATED! But would return to my classes in a neck brace. Okay, so fast forward to many years later and I begin to have non- stop stomach viruses. They were also linked to a period of time with massive migraines, sinus polyps, walking pneumonia, two sinus surgeries, allergies, and then the hunt began. 1996 I had a hysterectomy and appendectomy because of repetitive ovarian cysts bursting and forming with endometriosis. Along with the ongoing -unrelenting GI issues. Things would calm for a period of time. Then I would go into fight to keep my job to only lose it again with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain recurring again with bouts of constipation. The dehydration and migraines with a merry- go- round of symptoms hiding themselves from the normal tests made diagnosis difficult back in 1996 - 1998. I would be fired from my teaching job... Get another job .. Then be fired from it while in a hospital bed. Then while in the gastroenterologist Merry-go-round ... a precious Doctor told me ... ""I am referring you to a motility specialist."" I immediately asked him, "" do you think I am crazy? What kind of doctor is that?"" Because to be honest, this was getting a little crazy and at this point, I had never heard of a motility specialist! 1999 He reassured me and this phase of my journey would lead me to Dr Thomas Abell ... Thank God! Who removed the question marks and got everything stabilized enough to do testing and begin the diagnostic phase. The answers weren't easy.. But the point of this whole story is ... I would not have found out, I had gastroparesis, a paralyzed colon ( pseudo-obstruction) , received help for these migraines ( abdominal based) and went on to peel back the layers of sjogrens and mitochondrial malabsorption disorder.... Neuropathy. ( i probably left something out ... I live in a semi- state of denial) The first set of doctors were the ""best"" but clueless! The second tried, but referred me, and that led me to the ""third time is blessed! "" The third attempt I was blessed enough to meet a Doctor who had trained under Dr Thomas Abell! 2000 He would go on to send me to South Carolina and Dr Lahr and have a colectomy - which changed life measurably. Did not change the facts, but made it less miserable! So, from a diagnosis in 1999 to today trying to stay alive~~~ the theme is persevere one moment at a time. Doing what is necessary is not easy, nor do we always have the strength to do so, but it is better to go forward .. No matter how tedious or difficult! So, on this synopsis of a journey which did not accept the gastric electrical stimulator, I have gone through a PICC line placement from 1999 - 2005, port-a-cath placements from 2005 - present. ( on fifth port) I celebrate today, but pray for a better tomorrow and research with diagnosis codes which allows for treatment without hearing "" we know you need this, but because others have messed up - we have limits which have been put on us"" Then you ration your meds.., and the insurance company decides not to pay for an item which meets the criteria for which they are basing their denial! We are survivors of this journey- have perseverance ~~ even in those moments when we feel our well is empty!",,doctor,doctor,migraine,job,diagnosis,Early Childhood Education,constipation,insurer,exam,expert

770,"My story begins and ends with a plea to lawmakers. Our Declaration of Independence lists our ""inalienable rights"" of ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"". I ask you to give me and my fellow sufferers with gastroparesis those rights. There are numerous medications and treatments for gastroparesis in other countries that have not been allowed in the USA. These are approved by the World Health Organization using the same strict standards as our own FDA. Why are these treatment options not available to us? I can only surmise it is because the powerful drug companies here in the USA are keeping them out. Patents held by companies in other countries are a threat to profits. I implore you to write legislation to open up these medications and treatments to those of us that suffer. I have a right to life, and a medication outside of our country is the only thing that sustains my health and life. I have the right of liberty. Give me that legal right to obtain my medication abroad and still live in this country. I have the right to pursue happiness, which can only be if I am healthy. On my medication I am healthy, happy and a productive contributor to society. My story: I was a totally healthy person until the summer of 2006. I experienced a sudden onset of nausea and pain upon eating. Six months of testing revealed I had idiopathic gastroparesis. I was put on Reglan for four weeks. It did nothing for me so my gastroenterologist stopped it. Then I began to have uncontrollable movements: tics, shaking, fasiculations, muscle cramps, Dystonia.The neurologist diagnosed me with Tardive Dyskinesia from Reglan. It was permanent neurological damage. The next medication for gastroparesis I was given was Zelnorm. This worked great. I was able to eat without pain, nausea nor the chronic constipation that accompanies gastroparesis. I was on this over four months before it was FDA banned. I then had a pacemaker surgically placed on my stomach. This also did nothing to help me so I had it removed in November 2007. I was 90 lbs, stomach flu like symptoms of vomiting and nausea all the time. I was offered a feeding tube, but refused it. It would do nothing for my nausea and I didn't want to be kept alive like that. Do you remember when you had the stomach flu? Would you want to live the rest of your life like that? So I went online to write my goodbyes to my G-pact friends. G-pact is an online support group: Gastroparesis Patient Association for Cures and Treatments. When I logged on someone had just written they got Zelnorm from an online pharmacy. I clicked the link and the website looked like a scam. I was dying anyway so I gave them my credit card number. Eight days later I I got my medicine, Zelnorm, and lived a happy, productive life for over four years. Then the supply ran out. The company had purchased Novartis's stock of Zelnorm and it was gone. My doctor put me on erythromycin, which didn't help, but it was my only option, or so I thought. I lived miserably for a year or two until August 2014. I began to have severe pain and couldn't keep any food down. I got down to 90 lbs again then went into starvation ketosis in December 2014. My brain was stealing from my muscles and vital organs to die last A CT Scan on December 12 showed the surgeon left a looping wire lead attached to a stomach nerve from my 2007 removal surgery. That was the source of my pain. My hospital stay was good at first in that the cardiologist saved my heart.But then she and another doctor thought I was anorexic instead of having gastroparesis. They filled me with massive doses of benzodiazapines and had me eat 5 trays of food that was all indigestible for a person with gastroparesis. I passed the psychiatric exams with flying colors and the doctor told me to leave. I couldn't digest the food they made me eat. My primary care doctor read the reports and was angry. He took me off all medication since I was now unintentionally addicted to benzodiazapines. I detoxed at my mom's house. 3 days of Hell, then a half-life of 3 weeks of half-Hell. Now it will be 2 years if occasional reoccurring insomnia, hallucinations, nervousness, ringing in my ears and other horrible symptoms. I had to take harsh laxatives to rid myself of the indigestible food, which came out as identifiable as it went in. On December 27, 2014 I was 85 lbs, dehydrated and hearing dead family members and friends talking to me. My husband and my mom awaited my inevitable death.I slept 2 hours and woke up Sunday, December 28 at midnight and I felt stronger and better. I ate some gastroparesis safe soft foods. I was skin and bones. My muscles were gone. It took all my strength to use a walker and get out of bed to walk 15 steps to the toilet. My doctor ran tests and was surprised that the starvation ketosis only gave me severe muscle loss but did no damage to my internal organs. My gastroenterologist was shocked that I didn't die, and had never seen anyone recover from what I went through. So now I am rebuilding my muscles through physical therapy.This is hugely difficult work, but I am doing it. It is no surprise that I lost my job. I am still at my mom's house and cannot return to my home because it is at 8,000 ft and the doctors say I'm not strong enough for that yet. I am on Marinol for nausea and pain. I am on Linzess for chronic constipation. Palative Care. Neither of these help the real problem. I need a prokinetic. I found Zelnorm online again. Novartis's Mexico company is making it under a different name. I also found Gasmotin, Japan's prokinetic, used safely in 33 countries since 2006. I have ordered both of these, but they may get confiscated at the border. If that is the case I will have to leave this country and live abroad. I find this reality intolerable. Are we not the ""land of the free""? Where is my ""inalienable right"" to life? Where is my liberty to medicines approved by the World Health Organization? Why can't I, and others like me, pursue happiness? We suffer when answers lay outside our borders because USA drug companies keep a monopoly. It is up to lawmakers to fix this problem and legislate our ""unalienable rights"" here in this country. Until then I must do what I need to do to stay alive. That is my right as an American, as I see it. If it is not my right to get the medicine I need, I must change citizenship to a free country. If so, I suggest we all do that too.",,country,medication,doctor,doctor,food,drug,pain,nausea,treatment,company
771,"I was officially diagnosed with Gastroparesis in March of 2014. However, my doctors feel that I have been suffering with it for much longer. In 2007 following a surgical biopsy I was diagnosed with Reflux. I had started experiencing classic reflux symptoms with heart burn and a lump sensation in my throat. The piece that didn't fit was constant and random regurgitation of undigested food. I started anti-reflux medication and significantly changed my diet. I felt well for many years controlling my symptoms with diet. I was living as cleanly as possible,eating well, and exercising regularly. I was a long distance runner and just got used to the fact that my body didn't tolerate nutrition the same as everyone else's did. I threw up during long runs and would be violently I'll afterward, but felt determined to finish that first marathon. About a year and a half ago I completed my last half marathon and haven't run a step since. From that time on my body stopped tolerating food altogether. By Christmas of 2013 nothing of substance would stay down. And so it began, the long road to figure out what was causing this. I had another EGD in February along with a complete work up for any possible autoimmune disorder that was causing my anemia and constant stomach pain. EGD was normal. A gastric emptying study was ordered in March which confirmed the diagnosis of Gastroparesis which led me to find out all I could about this illness and how to treat it. I was started on Zofran which I took like candy for the following 9 months and even with that was unable to keep down anything more than a few hundred calories a day. I maintained myself on a complete liquid diet of meal supplements as recommended by my doctor for about 9 months and then my body stopped tolerating those as well. I was found to have slowed motility throughout the entire digestive tract. My weight and health continued to drop. This December my doctor recommended placing a GJ tube. I have been on a continuous feeding schedule since then. I know this is not a cure, but it is helping me and I am so thankful for that. I want to encourage anyone struggling to never give up hope. Timeline: February 2014- EGD March 2014-Gastric Emptying Study May 2014- CT Scan of abdomen and pelvis August 2014- Repeat Gastric Emptying Test September 2014- MR enterography November 2014- Colonoscopy (cleanse prep did not work, possible most painful 24 hours of my life) December 2014- Iron infusion December 2014- SITS marker test December 2014- GJ tube placement with 4 day hospital stay for re feeding syndrome. Upcoming: Button placement January 28! Possible colon resection surgery. And who knows what else, but today I'm feeling so thankful for my feeding tube and all of the support of my friends and family!

772,"I thought my life couldn't possibly get any worse. Yes, I have an amazing husband and three awesome kids ranging from age 13-22. Sometime around February of 2014 I was called to come into my doctors office immediately. He walked in the room and had two boxes in his one hand. I shook my head, ""No No No"" as he said ""Yes Yes Yes"". My blood sugar was way of the grid. I was close to kidney failure. He monitored me closely for weeks. And I corrected my diet, took my meds faithfully and joined the gym. I hated the idea of having diabetes but I was smiling. I lost 60lbs and was happy about myself. I accepted being a diabetic. May 2014, Mother's Day weekend. Small things started happening, one by one. Why was my foot hurting from the water of the shower hitting it? ""How odd."" The next day same thing, only this time the water is hurting various spots of my skin on the right side. At work I go get a nice hot cup of tea. Wait a minute. Did I just say HOT? Why dont I feel it hot or burning my hand like usual since supplying us with these cheap cups. OUCH! Why is it so hot in my left hand? I decide to go over to some of my friends at there work area. ""Here, hold this and tell me what you feel."" There reply? ""Hot"". Well why cant I feel it in my right hand? What is going on? I dont remember if it was that night or the next but one of my good friends took me over to the hospital. They ran so many test. No, not MS...No, not Lymes...not neuropathy since thats bi-lateral and whatever was happening to me was lateral. Even the doctors were baffled. After seeing 3 seperate Neurologist the only thing they can possibly chalk it up to is a ""Sensory Stroke."" Not your common stroke where it affects your heart. This only effected my entire right sides senses. Four months later and i was just learning to just deal with my new ""Senses."" August 2014 I got hit with a nasty virus. It made me feel so drained for two weeks after. Well, at least I wasnt vomiting. You see, I have a fear. Emetophobia! The fear of vomiting. September rolls around and again I find myself with some sort of virus. A week later, im nauseas as all heck. Why is this happening so much? More days past and im vomiting. ....more days pass and im nauseas. ..then vomiting. The cycle just kept going. The nausea alone was lasting longer and longer. I couldn't lay on my stomach to read or sleep because it would activate the nausea and vomiting more so. I stopped all my other medications think maybe one of them was the problem. Maybe I was allergic to one, especially my night ones since taking my meds then always seemed to cause the vomiting. I started eating only saltines and soups. I was affraid anything else would just come back out. Finally I gave in to my friends offer, after 6 weeks, to take me to the hospital. Blood work, urine, questions, IV, nausea/vomit medication. 24 hours and no food, no drink, none of my other meds and the endoscopy begins. ""Let's check out that gall bladder or possibly hernia."" As I am waking up I recall hearing, ""Your stomach is completely full."" Then I hear that weird word? Gastro huh? What is that? Well come on lets fix this....no more vomiting. I wish it was that easy. My fear of vomiting has just manifested! Of all things! Of all diseases, leave it to me to get the one to live off my fear! I was left in the E.R. with no explanation. No understanding. I couldn't even pronounce the word. Gastroparesis. As any of us would do, I went home and hit the internet. ""Google, tell me what gastroparesis is."" Ok, I can do this, its not so bad. Whoooo, death? Slowly starving to death? No cure? Limited medications? And the tears rolled. Funny, people say, I'm looking good. They truly have no idea whats happening. How it feels. What am I suppose to say? ""You jerk...im sick, its a disease and it cant be fixed? No, I cant. Im the one that always puts on that make believe happy face. The silly one. The one to make everyone laugh. The one to be there the best that I can and give all I possibly can to others. The strong one. But now, like so many before me, I suffer. We all suffer....one way or another. Some more then others. We have good days. We have bad days. Abdominal pains, nausea, vomiting, weight gain, weight lose, bloating, malnutrition, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, feeling full after just ONE bit...yes, ONE bit! Now everyday is a new journey...a new struggle. And just how do you actually tell your friends what its really like. Oh sure, of course they know vomiting. But they dont know everything else. There is no cure. There is limited medication. I cant enjoy my foods anymore. Not without suffering the consequences. And that just brings out my fear! Imagine having the flu. You see how horrible you feel? Thats only temporary. My flu and 5 million others last forever!! This disease needs to be paid more attention to. So why did I explain so much? Two reasons. The doctor has no clue why I actually have it since it tends to effect diabetics who have had it for years, but I have not. And the second most important reason, to myself at least, to hopefully give a little more strength to myself to get out of bed and keep moving everyday. Why? Because I'm scared!!!!",,vomiting,nausea,medication,friend,disease,doctor,doctor,know-how,right hand,death
773,"In 2010 I gave birth to my first son and suffered a 4th degree tear- as a result of a vacuum delivery and episiotomy. Soon after I started having issues with continence but didn't really connect the dots. After a year or so of realizing that something wasn't right, I had a GI doc do a rectal exam and discovered that most of my sphincter muscle was missing. I was referred to a colo-rectal surgeon and had several more test done that determined that I had ZERO continence. I can hold nothing in, liquid or solid. And I have severe nerve damage so signals are always getting mixed up down there. I take Imodium every day, I've had Solesta injections, and a Sacral Nerve stimulator implant put in to try and help control the problem. I would say with all of that, I have about 20% more control- that's it. I also suffer from IBS and GERD and have been having major hormonal problems brought on by the stress of all of this. I am seriously considering having a colostomy done and hope that it will help at least let me live my life. I have two young sons, a job, and a less than sympathetic family (but who can blame them) who really just thinks I'm being over dramatic most of the time. ""At least you're not dying"" they tell me. I mostly just want to die at this point since I'm exhausted of this being the only thing on my mind all of the time. I never go out with friends and live in constant fear of a stomach virus. I live a fearful existence, never sure of what my gut might do that day. I tell my husband he should leave me and find someone he can enjoy life with, because I will never enjoy my life again.",,son,exam,husband,birth,existence,fearful,virus,stomach,constant,friend
774,"Hello; I am a 69 year old woman who when I was just 18 years old I had a Duodenal Ulcer. The doctors did not know then that a Duodenal Ulcer could be caused by bacteria. My ulcer was. It was caused by H-Pylori. Never knew until 15 years ago. They found it anti-bodies in my blood and for some reason they put me on a two week horrible treatment. Months later they tested my blood once again and saw anti-bodies. A second treatment caused me to have 3 Seizures. Scared my poor husband half to death. I later researched and found out that the only way to know if you have h-pylori is by having an Endoscopy or this test where you drink a foul fluid and then breathe into a specially coated bag, wait so many hours and the bag is checked the bacteria will show up in the treated bag as a positive infection. The anti-bodies just showed that I had already had the infection, probably when I had my ulcer at the age of 18. Anyhow, the H-Pylori did a job on my stomach and I have been living with G.E.R.D. for 19 years.The many stories I have read are exactly how I live each day. I had to take prilosec for a year. It was the worst medication I have ever taken. I felt worse on it. It caused my whole body to become unbalanced. I refuse to take any kind of medication that is like that and have just tried to eat right and do what is best for me to be able to survive on what foods are out there for me to be able to digest and not have an episode. I do have Anxiety and a Seizure Disorder. That does not help. I too will eat something I should not and pay for it in the end. I walk a lot because I believe that it is a very good way of digesting food and having it pass through the stomach so it does not sit there. We are all different so we must find ways to get nourishment. I eat 5-6 very small meals a day. That for me is better but there have been days when I missed a couple of meals and ate one larger one and would find out that the smaller meals are much better. Even an apple would be one meal for me, or 1/4 lb. of Salmon. Put to much together and I have a problem. Have them hours apart and at least 4 hours before I go to bed is good for me. Bending, riding a bike, lifting something heavy pushes on my stomach and will cause an episode when sleeping. Walking is the key. When weather allows I walk 2-3 times a day for 1-3 miles. I even carry a small piece of food with me. I take Psyllium Fiber to help the food pass through my stomach a bit faster. I also have a Spastic Colon. I have my days when I get very low and that is when listening to others wonder what delicious meal they will have either for breakfast, lunch or dinner. No one understands just how difficult it is to live this way but those who have it. Know that you are not alone. There are millions of us. We just need to listen to our bodies and find our own way of dealing with this. We have to be brave and smart. Stay away from what hurts you. I know it is hard I live that way every day. I look at food as only nourishment, period! I pray for you all. We must try harder than others but I just know we can do it.",,meal,body,food,stomach,bag,bacterium,ulcer,blood,treatment,medication
775,"I have had IBS symptoms since a child, or young teenager. I first noticed symptoms (immediate diarrhea) on the first day of a new school, or moving from elementary to middle and from middle to highschool, taking my driving test etc. These were high stress situations for me. During my high school years, anytime I would sneak out or lie to my parents diarrhea would come on immediately. I thought it was my conscience telling me to behave. Then in my mid twenties, I began to have mild GERD symptoms, which increased quickly to intense reflux before 30. The early 30's brought on routine constipation. I was put on reflux (GERD) meds, but only told to take fiber supplements for the constipation. I finally put myself on probiotics. Probiotics were a game changer for me, since I suffered from severe ""trapped"" gas. The bloating was super painful. The constipation still remained even with probiotics. I began to experiment with natural remedies when the fiber supplements never really worked, only contributed to my gas. I tried drinking aloe vera juice which made no change. I tried coconut water, no help. I found a juice called plum smart and that did help me go, but near accidents were a problem. It was difficult to control. I finally was advised at a health food store to try a Chelated Magnesium supplement (miracle relief). This has me going regulary, and w/o diarrhea. I take 400mg per day. I had my magnesium levels checked to make sure I wasn't over dosing, and they were normal. Magnesium can affect your kidneys, and no one with kidney issues should use it. My regimen is fiber cereal in the am, apple/nuts snack, Chelated magnesium, probiotic, stool softner (hemorrhoids from constipation), and Nexium. I hope this helps someone.",,constipation,magnesium,flux,gas,juice,apple,child,CEREAL#2,store,store
776,"Before I tell my whole backstory, I want you to know, I have found a way to manage my GERD and it can definitely work for other people, too. Two years ago, I found this treatment, and my GERD symptoms went away completely (I could drink coffee, alcohol, eat spicy food again). I'm back to having bad acid reflux symptoms-- but that's only because I was supposed to take the stuff on an ""as needed"" basis, and instead, I ignored whenever I felt slight symptoms again. So it's my fault. When I was 18, I started feeling scary pain in my chest on a daily basis, and went to a doctor. After getting an upper GI, I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia, gastritis, and GERD. At that time, I was put on Protonix, and I took that for an entire year. After I felt like my symptoms weren't coming back, I stopped taking it one day and felt fine. A couple years later (when I was 22), I had a major toothache that required a root canal-- and I was taking the maximum amount of ibuprofen for a couple weeks. This aggravated my esophagus and my GERD symptoms came back full force (pain in the chest, bloating, rawness and a lump sensation in my throat, regurgitating food...). I went to a doctor, and since my insurance wasn't great, I was told to take 2 Prilosec a day for as long as I had symptoms. I followed through with this for 2 months and had absolutely no relief. One day, I went in to a licensed acupuncturist who practices chinese medicine, for something unrelated (allergies). I was nervous about it and it was my first time every trying alternative medicine. During my consultation, he asked me a lot of questions and found out I had acid reflux. He told me, ""I can get rid of that. If you want, I'll put you on some herbs and you'll get better."" I was really skeptical, but since the pills I had been taking had no effect, I thought it wouldn't hurt to try, especially when he was making such a strong claim regarding its effectiveness. He gave me this GROSS powdered mixture of herbs, which I had to take twice a day dissolved in tea. It made my blood pressure go up, so he also put me on a liquid herb mixture to counteract that, which worked. After just a week and a half of taking the stuff (which is all natural-- herbs, and ground cuttlefish bone), I stopped getting hearburn and the other related symptoms. Over the next couple months, I was gradually weaned off the strong gross powdered mixture (I took a couple other less intense herb mixtures, ending with one in a capsule form), and one day, the Chinese doctor told me I could stop taking anything. I was totally better. I could exercise with no symptoms, eat whatever I wanted... it was amazing. However, he did tell me I should take the capsule form herbal mixture whenever I started to feel symptoms again (which is a reality, having a hiatal hernia). Unfortunately, I ignored that piece of advice. Now, a couple years later (I'm 25) after having symptoms once in a while only during stressful times in my life, I let the acid reflux get REALLY bad again-- back to where it was before. So finally, I went back to the same Chinese medicine doctor a week ago and started taking the gross powdered stuff again. I'm supposed to take it for another week before I go in to see him again. But, I can tell you that I'm already feeling relief again! So much so that a couple days ago I started drinking coffee again and eating fried foods, and quickly realized it's still too early to do that... my esophagus needs to heal first. I just wanted to share all of this, because I never thought I would be the ""kind of person"" who takes herbal stuff to treat a chronic illness like this. But it worked better for me than anything else I've ever tried, and actually cured my heartburn for a couple years, during which I didn't need to take anything. And I fully believe it will work again, once I've finished the cycle of treatment again.",,couple,herb,food,flux,doctor,doctor,alternative medicine,treatment,capsule,acid

778,"HI, I have been wondering for some time why I had a chronic cough for 16 years! I have been to numerous doctors for it. They have given me Advair thinking it was some king of Asthma. Also allergy medicines for allergy because I also had post nasal drip with it. I too thought the post nasal drip caused my cough and curious enough I used the Advair for years thinking it was helping somewhat. I saw a chest specialist and went through 2 bronchoscopies, CT scans, Allergy testing, and a scope down my throat for acid reflux. Nothing was conclusive. I cough when I talk, get excited or laugh. I cough when I eat, my nose runs too! It is no way to live! I occasionally cough up little blood clots too. Not only that to add insult to injury when I cough it causes incontinence. Just recently I have come to find out by a video I just watched tonight that my cough is caused by Acid Reflux! I am so happy I finally know what I am dealing with although I am not looking forward to giving up some of my favorite foods for the rest of my life! But what I am even more worried about is the possibility of Esophageal cancer! Considering I have been living with this cough and other symptoms for 16 years and no one could conclusively diagnose me! So now I have to go into a doctor and tell them I need to have my esophagus looked at thoroughly to see if I am ok. I have had the endoscope thing done before and it was one of the most uncomfortable things I have ever had done! I swore I would never do it again, but I guess I have to to make sure I don't have cancer... So scary! But if anyone has a cough symptom like me please check out Dr. Jaimie Koufman.

779,"DHA advocate Lindsay has made great strides to raise awareness and funds for gastroparesis. The first annual Go With Your Gut 5K was held in Hilliard, Ohio, on August 23rd of 2014. Lindsay crushed her $3,000 fundraising goal, bringing in more than $9,000 to benefit research into idiopathic gastroparesis through the DHA and IFFGD. Her dedication to improving the lives of all people with gastroparesis is an inspiration. Thank you, Lindsay. An Advocate's Story My name is Lindsay Slivka. I am a 36 year old wife and mother of two children. I have a doctorate in audiology and work for a hospital system performing hearing screenings on newborns. While training for a half marathon in February 2010, I started having pain in my right side and difficulty breathing. I went through nearly every cardio-pulmonary test imaginable. I remember saying to my pulmonologist, “I have not been able to eat as much as usual for the last six weeks. I feel really full all of the time and just can’t eat what I used to.” His response was “I have no idea what that is all about” and told me there was nothing left for him to do for me. I figured I had to live with my symptoms and kept going. In the fall of 2012 I called a family friend that is a gastroenterologist. He said to come in for an endoscopy and he would see if he could find anything. He called me the day after the test and was stunned to tell me I had celiac disease. In fact, there was an extreme amount of damage in my GI tract, suggesting a long standing problem. I immediately started following a gluten free diet. Over the next 5 weeks, instead of getting better, I kept getting more ill, until I could not even sip water without feeling like I was going throw up. That is when I was diagnosed with gastroparesis. Like many others with gastroparesis, I have gone through a number of medications, procedures, and alternative healthcare practices trying to manage my symptoms of nausea, fullness, stomach pain and chest pain. In March of 2012, a feeding tube was placed through my nose into my small intestine. Still unable to take in enough calories, I had a central line place in April 2012 and use TPN (IV nutrition) daily. I am able to eat some food and focus on eating high quality, nutrient dense food. I find daily exercise to be incredibly helpful in keeping my symptoms under control and to help me keep a positive attitude. It is my intention to promote advocacy and raise awareness to help the millions worldwide living gastroparesis. I am determined to find ways to manage symptoms, help others cope with gastroparesis, fund research, as well as promote awareness and advocacy through events such as the “Go With Your Gut 5k” and my websitewww.navigatinggastroparesis.wordpress.com. Very little is known about GP and without some intense research, those of us who struggle to deal with this disease are in desperate need of help that can only come from a better understanding of why this happens. The inaugural “Go With Your Gut 5k and 1 mile walk” was held August 23rd, 2014 in Hilliard Ohio. We had a great turn out for our first event, over 175 people registered! We love seeing people in the t-shirts from the event! We raised over $9,000 for research for Digestive Health Alliance. We are planning the second annual event for August 22, 2015.

780,"My Gastroparesis Story My name is Trisha and I am sharing my personal story to give you an inside look at what it's like living with this awful and misunderstood disease. I have had GI-related issues and numerous sporadic episodes of being unable to eat due to pain and nausea/vomiting for many years, but none of the episodes has been anywhere close to being as severe or long-lasting as the issue I have now. In early February of 2013, I became sick with what we thought was a common stomach bug. I was unable to eat or receive an adequate amount of fluids orally, due to severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. As I progressively got weaker and the symptoms increased, my doctor diagnosed me with possible diverticulitis. After a few trips to the ER, with little help and no real improvement, my family and I knew that this was not a stomach bug, so I decided to see a GI doctor for my issues. My GI ran a number of imaging tests, but could not find anything that would be causing my inability to intake any nutrition without pain, nausea, lack of appetite, and vomiting. After a couple of months went by and I continued to get weaker and lose weight, my GI referred me to a urologist and a gynecologist. Neither could come up with a reasonable diagnosis to explain my symptoms. They referred me to a surgeon for a diagnostic laparoscopy. I never made it to that appointment because my husband had had enough of me going from doctor to doctor with no results. I was not improving, still unable to eat months after initially getting sick, vomiting/heaving over anything that went in my mouth, and in lots of pain. So one morning, he drove me to UNC, where I was admitted for testing. I went home the following week on a liquids-only diet; however I was unable to drink an adequate amount of fluids, became dehydrated, and was facing awful side effects from Reglan, the medication the UNC doctors had put me on. I had to return to UNC as an inpatient once again. I had to receive nutrition, and it was clear that I would not be getting it orally. In May 2013, I had to resort to having a GJ feeding tube placed in my small intestine, which I still have today. I have a machine that pumps formula into my body for at least 15 hours a day. I have to wear a backpack carrying this formula all day. At first, it was hard to accept, but God helped me gain peace, and I became comfortable with wearing the bag in public. (I admit a more comfortable and stylish bag did help some as well.) I have continued to have rough days but have been able to function ""normally"" on most days. The past 6 months though have been extremely difficult for me physically and emotionally, though, as my body has begun having trouble with tolerating enough calories via the tube. Surviving on less than 500 calories a day doesn't give me much energy at all. I am a 5th grade Science/Social Studies teacher. I love teaching with a passion, and this year is my 15th year as an elementary teacher. However, due to illness and other hospitalizations, I have been unable to work. To begin with I was angry and upset. I honestly thought that I was fulfilling my purpose by being a teacher and loving mother, so why was my body keeping me from being in the classroom? I questioned God's reasons for making me endure the pain and suffering of this debilitating disease. Was I not following the path he desired for me? I honestly try my best to live my life with as much love, understanding, and patience as I can. With many prayers and discussions with God, I finally discovered what I believe is another purpose for my life; at least I hope that's what it is. Some doctors have me diagnosed as having “Gastroparesis” which means a “paralyzed stomach.” I have learned that the majority of the public and even medical providers/physicians are not aware of this debilitating disease. Some doctors label me as having a “Functional GI Motility Disorder.” Regardless of the label, my life has drastically changed. Since my diagnosis, I have seen multiple doctors/nurses. I have had many return visits to the ER for dehydration, uncontrollable pain and nausea, and feeding tube issues. Every 3 months I have to return to Interventional Radiology and have my feeding tube replaced, sometimes even sooner, if it clogs or falls out. I was an active parent, wife, daughter, and teacher before my illness. I was overweight, but otherwise healthy and felt great prior to this illness. Since getting sick, I have lost approximately 160 pounds, and on most days, especially recently, feel too awful to be active. My quality of life has diminished, but I will continue to fight to get it back. At first, I felt strong and brave, thinking I could live my life the same as always. I would just have a different way of receiving my nutrition. Instead of eating, I would tube feed. To begin with, I tried feeding at night so that I could feel and look ""normal"" during the day. But I was not ""normal"" anymore. I was struggling to get through my day at work, just to come home and crash with my family. I gave up trying to hide my illness, and decided to begin wearing my backpack during the day to run my feeds in hopes that my energy would improve. I wear my backpack all day, regardless of whether I am working, grocery shopping, or going to a doctor's visit. Although I love my teaching career, I am currently on medical leave because my body cannot keep up with my physical demands. I am praying to regain my strength and get my symptoms under control so I can soon return to teaching soon, as I miss it greatly. I was hospitalized this past October (2014) for almost 2 weeks because my body couldn’t even handle the formula that I was trying to send through my GJ tube. In December (2014) I had my gallbladder removed, and since then, I have been trying to increase my feeds so I can function and regain my strength. I am currently surviving on less than 700 calories (tube fed) a day. I despise how this disease makes me feel guilty over missing family events and not being able to attend some of my children’s activities. I hate not being able to easily go out to eat, to sporting events, camping, vacations, or any of the other things I enjoyed prior to my illness. I am young and should have lots of life ahead of me, but instead am struggling to find a cure or treatment that can allow me to actively live again. It's hard to fathom that there is not a cure for Gastroparesis/FGIMD and that I may have to deal with feeling like this for the remainder of my life. Gastroparesis is an ""invisible disease"", which means that no one knows that I am sick by just looking at me. They make comments about how great I look after losing so much weight. They don't understand when I tell them thanks for the compliment, but I lost all of my weight from not being able to eat anything and would rather be heavier than feel the way I do. I am angry at times. My insurance will not cover my formula that is required for me to survive and puts hurdles in my way before covering certain treatment options. Sometimes when I see a new doctor or nurse, I have to TEACH THEM what is wrong with me, what kind of medications I need that work, and which medications I have to stay away from. I am heartbroken when I make some exciting plans with the family, but then I have to cancel because of being sick. I want MY LIFE back! I have been blessed, though, with receiving help and support from those around me. I am fortunate to have found a wonderful GI doctor who actually listens, seems to genuinely care, and attempts to help me manage my symptoms. Additionally, I am appreciative of the support I receive from my ever-growing GP community. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. God has NEVER failed me and NEVER will. Through this storm, a wonderful bond was formed with two of my fellow GP warriors. We are using social media and our advocacy group to create web pages, community pages, Twitter movements, gastroparesis-related events, letter writing campaigns to elected officials, the media, and medical providers. We are writing and distributing petitions, making awareness videos, creating fundraisers, and participating in all sorts of other activities to support the GP community. With God's help, we have formed a magnificent team. I have come to realize and accept that God has set forth this path for me. I HATE GASTROPARESIS! It has been a thorn in my side; however, with God's assistance, I am finding my way.",,doctor,doctor,God,pain,disease,body,nausea,teacher,teacher,family

782,"Hi my name is Rebecca and I was diagnosed with Mild Gastroparesis in 2006. I have always suffered with constipation from childhood and was very familiar with laxatives growing up. I also had a lot of tummy aches. However when I became a young adult; I found a way to keep my constipation under control for first time in my life; and, that was simply by drinking a 6 oz. glass of Prune Juice followed by a glass of water each night before bed. This worked for me for about 17 - 20 years. And for the first time in my life, i did not suffer with tummy aches, bladder issues or any digestive issues at all. I truly knew what it meant to feel good. However probably about a year before I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis; my constipation came back with a vengeance!! And this was in spite of drinking plenty of water; exercising 5 - 7 times a week; and, eating relatively well-balanced meals. In other words trying to take care of myself. I went immediately to have a colonoscopy done because of my age at the time, which was mid 40's; and, I just thought it would be a good idea to have that done sine I had issues from childhood. They found nothing and I was told to eat more fruit, which ended up making matters worse. Due to work; raising children; and, taking care of three elderly family members; I was forced as I waited on the doctors to come up with a solution, to start using laxatives. At some point during that time, I gradually began to experience the horrible bloating and indigestion that are part of Gastroparesis symptoms; and, I could not eat or drink without blowing up like a balloon. It was unbearable; and, when I was in that condition I could not empty my bladder. So for approximately two years I was taking Castor Oil and or Milk of Magnesia just to get through my days; and, I spent my nights cat- napping on the bathroom floor. I could not understand what was happening to me. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get the doctors to listen to what I was telling them; and, I could get no relief whatsoever. I sunk into deep, deep depression; and, I tried to kill myself one day when everyone was gone, because by this time I had been out of work for two (2) months and weighted only 85lbs; was not being taken seriously by doctors; and, could not eat and could barely drink. What I thought would be fixed in a few visits to the doctor had turned my life upside down; and, I saw no way out and could not imagine another 30 years or so of living this way. At this time I had not heard of Gastroparesis; and, even though I had had the Gastric Emptying Study (GES); the doctors did not mention that I had ""Mild"" Gastroparesis. I found out about it on a show; and, then asked the doctors about it at that time; and, the answers where very elusive for a long time until they finally did tell me. But at this time I was unaware of Online Support Groups and knew nothing about this horrible illness. I felt very alone and isolated. Nine (9) years later I am still here and still living with this illness; and, I am not sure how this story for me is going to end. I finally went down again in August of 2014, and am in the process of filing for Disability because I have fought this for nine (9) years and pushed myself to the point of utter and complete exhaustion; but, I have since found the Online Gastroparesis Support Groups; I have started one of my own; I have met some amazing people - STRONG WARRIORS!! I have also learned much about this horrible illness; and, I am trying to help educate other's through my GP Group. I have also met an amazing man with a colon irrigation device that he is trying to help me get through my insurance company because I also have colonic inertia. So we are hoping that if I can get some relief from that, then maybe I can better manage my Gastroparesis; which I now know can be brought on by laxative abuse; but, then we do what we have to do when it comes to functioning. I hope this illness will not beat me. I have a different perspective than I did nine (9) years ago. I have a wonderful GI doctor now after going through five (5) GI's; I have a wonderful psychologist whom helps with the depression associated with this or any chronic illness; and, a psychiatrist whom has given me some mild meds to help me cope and get sleep. Sleep which I missed out for a very long time. So my goals today are very different than they were nine (9) years ago. They are to Spread Awareness and Bring About Change; they are to Educate People who are new to the illness so they can be better prepared to talk with their Physicians; and, to be supportive to those who are struggling to come to terms with this horrible illness. Gastroparesis is real. It is not in our heads; and, everyone that I have talked to whom has this illness has said all of the same things: it has completely changed their life; sometimes they feel like giving up; doctors don't seem to understand; and, they would not wish this illness on anyone.

783,"April of 2009 changed my life forever. I'd just finished exercising and was hungry. I ate something with cheese on it, the next thing I knew, I was having the WORST stomach pangs. I'd had stomach problems all my life, but nothing like this. The next thing I knew I had diarrhea and projectile vomiting at the same time. My 9 yr old daughter called 911 because her mommy was screaming in so much pain. It was after this that I was diagnosed with GERD and IBS. From that day forth I stopped eating pork, beef, dairy, and fried foods. I had to figure out what triggered this episode and to NEVER put my baby through that again. It was horrible at first, not knowing what to and what not to eat. The only good thing that came from this was I lost 70 lbs. It's hard to enjoy family gatherings and vacations because I never know when I'll have a flare up. Dicyclomine has become my BEST friend.

Then i started using lots of heavy drugs for a few years and abusing them got me a little confused but i managed to keep some balance..tho one day someone lied to me and i ended up taking 5 times more amphetamines (derivative) than i wanted to and the next day i woke up with acid relux symptoms (my guess is the nervous stress caused by this insane dose of stimulants triggered a hiatal hernia.. and thats what they found after an endoscopy. Anyway the good news is that the severe throat burn caused by the avid reflux (+ nasty ecigarettes and normal cigarettes) made me quit ALL drugs including cigarettes.. Everything. its only been one year of on and off mild stomach burns and xontinious throat burn so ill see how it goes with anti-acids and PPIs and natural herbal cures.. also im.confident that lifestyle changes (more sport, vegeterian organic food) and yoga, qigong and other healing practices will enable me to heal my throat, oesophagus and limit/stop the acid reflux so that i can function again as a normal person and follow my dreams and by happy. note: my burns and reflux havent stoped me from doing sport or studying.  :) ill update this in a few years probably.

785,"Through her blog, Eats and Exercise by Amber, and by becoming the face of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Outcome Study (IBSOS), Awareness Ambassador Amber has worked to raise awareness of IBS and encourage hope and perseverance in all those suffering with the disorder. Check out her blog. And, watch her interview with local news channel WIVB4. IBS - three letters that used to control my life. I always had stomach issues. In elementary school, I was notorious for throwing up in class. At seven, I got my first endoscopy and missed two weeks of school because I was so sick. Growing up, there was a lot of throwing up. Waking up in the middle of the night, getting sick, and then being fine in the morning with no explanation. At fifteen, I got my gallbladder taken out but the random throwing up continued. I was told that I had IBS, was given a prescription for Nexium and lived off of Pepto Bismal. While feeling nauseous wasn't fun, my symptoms were manageable. I could eat what I wanted, as much as I wanted, and never had to think twice about my bathroom habits. IBS was just something I had, and up until my sophomore year of college, it wasn't so bad... 2011 was when my IBS symptoms spiraled out of control. I don't remember how it started, but the next thing I knew, my stomach was the size of a beach ball and an X-ray showed that my intestines were completely filled with stool. I didn't understand how I was constipated; I was still going to the bathroom. I was told to take some Miralax and thought I had found the solution to my problems. Little did I know that this would be the start of my struggle with my completely out of control and chronic flare-ups. Over the next three years, I was poked and prodded at like a science experiment. I had countless endoscopies, colonoscopies, biopsies, a colon pressure exam, the Smart Pill test, as well as a slew of blood work which all came back inconclusive. Slow transit time, a loopy colon, weak sphincter muscles, but nothing was found to be the root of all my suffering. I cut out dairy, but that didn't make a difference, and despite being diagnosed with Celiac Disease, going gluten free did not alleviate my symptoms. Slowly, my medication totaled 10 pills a day, yet I was still experiencing flare-ups every two weeks. In addition, I developed unbearable stomach pain that sent me to the hospital twice, only to be sent home with pain killers for ""stomach pain, cause unknown"" and ""colic."" I sat teary eyed in my doctor's office saying I couldn't handle living my life like this. The extreme bloating and distension coupled with constipation raged on. I developed hemorrhoids that needed to be laser treated from trying to go to the bathroom so much. I constantly looked as if I was a few months pregnant. For this period of time, my IBS consumed not only my body but my mind as well. I lost track of all the college/life social events I declined because of my symptoms. I was missing out either because I was at home writhing in pain, bloated beyond recognition, or chained to the bathroom due to the constant laxative cleanses I had to endure. I began to hate my body and became afraid of food, because anything I ate would send my intestines into distress. In a desperate attempt for relief one summer night in 2013, a Google search led me to a clinical trial in my area. I completed the clinical trial for my IBS and since then have continued to work hard to pull myself out of the dark place my digestive condition was dragging me into. My entire outlook on my condition has changed which has helped me with managing my symptoms. I have a laundry list of foods I have to avoid (gluten, wheat, lactose, and FODMAPs) as well as a routine I need to follow to keep my irate intestines appeased, but I don't mind because this is the happiest and healthiest I have ever been. I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, but it does not have me. I am in control of my life, not my chronic condition. I am beautiful, bloated or not, because my self worth is not set on my reflection.

Over the past two years, this has become worse, where it is a constant daily occurrence. I cannot go to church, work, social gatherings, etc. without stinking out everyone around me. I have become so accustom to the odor, that I am not aware of how bad it is until others react. I have been to several doctors, having a colonoscopy, endoscopy, MRI, CT enterography, anorectal manometry, etc. I have failed to complete two glucose breath tests due to the presence of methane gas/bacterial overgrowth. I have been on numerous antibiotics and take a probiotic on a daily basis. The doctors have not witnessed my odor, so are having a hard time realizing the seriousness of these symptoms. They think it could be mental due to menopause. It definitely is not mental, it is rectal! I do not vomit or have diarrhea. I do not have abdominal pain, although I do have bloating. I do have regular stools; however, I am sometimes left with residue.

789,"I had an ulcer when I was 7 years old. My first experience with internal problems. In my 20's it was issues with constipation. It seemed like I tried everything under the sun. Some would work for awhile and then stop. In my mid 30's I was starting to have severe digestive issues, then pain, etc. I had an endoscopy which showed nothing. I was given different acid reducers finally working up to the PPI's. Then more problems so was sent for more tests. It took a year and a half to find out my gallbladder was not working. No stones, it was diagnosed as biliary dyskenesia. A little while after that I started having some similar problems but not constantly. Saw a different gastroenterologist and had an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. Nothing. Went back again and she finally tried an ERCP which showed sludge in the bile ducts. I had a sphincterotomy then because the sphincter wasn't working properly. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. In my forties I have had more problems with pain, terrible digestion. Have had more tests recently for the small intestine which have not showed anything except some dilated bowel this last time.

791,"IBS-C started in the summer of 1975 and I was hospitalized for 3 days in which I endured both upper and lower tests, and the doctor attributed the problem to stress; so I stopped driving taxi on the night shift, changed my diet, cut out alcohol, and went back to school. When I returned to driving taxi in 1982 none of the problems returned until one early--morning in the winter of 2005 I could not get off the toilet, and I started having Diarrhea every morning lasting for at least 8 episodes at least 4 days a week, and I took everything to try and stop the flow, and the only stoppage came is when the bowel emptied, and then I would try and sneak up on some food. I went to the VA ER numerous times and the ER Docs finally made an appointment for the GI Clinic, and I hd to wait 2 months for the visit; and, so in and out of the Clinic and I was tested for everything like I am allergic to milk, citrus and lactose intolerant. I was given Riffaiaxcin and it works great for 21 days I felt like I was 21 years old again; and the same thing happened with Ciproflaxin, but the Docs say they could not keep me on the drug because they did not want me to be dependent on the drug, not to mention, of course, that Riffa is 800 dollars a prescription. Finally, the Docs gave me a Low Carbo diet to adhere to, and that has been my salvation. I quit smoking over 6 years ago, and I don't drink, and I don't eat any food fry cooked in oil; no garlic; no Asian food except Pho; no fast food; nothing I am allergic to; just broiled and baked and bland.

792,"I've had IBS-D for over 20years now and have learned that anything high in fiber, fast food, prepackaged foods, alcohol and even milks will keep me running to the bathroom 4-5 times a day. sometimes it just doesn't matter what I eat, I'll get bloated, pains and then the diarrhea will start the next day. Of course, 30 minutes after I eat I'll have to use the restroom. So timing is everything. However, I don't let this condition stop me from living my life. I think the first part of having IBS is not being ashamed and hide your condition. Be open to yourself and others around you that you just might have to jump up and use the restroom without warning several times. I make it a habit to carry extra clothing, diaper wipes and depends with me. I commute to work 1 1/2 hours a day each way. My IBS is usually in the morning and sometimes I can't stop and find a restroom in time. So now, I just put on my adult diaper and go. If I make it I make it and if I don't, I can take off the disposable panty, pull out the wipes and I'm back on the road feeling fresh, clean and confident. I don't have to worry about changing my clothes if I have an episode. I will have to say that I still think the IBS starts in the stomach because it feels like an infection and your body just can't get the food out fast enough.

793,"I am a 51 year old woman. As a child (think 3 grade or so), I had constant constipation. Eventually, after a few years, it called itself down and I had a normal high school and college life (except what they thought was an ulcer, have since found out it was hiatal hernia). But then I graduated from college and the real world took it's toll. At 27 I was diagnosed with IBS. Every thing I ate went right through me in about 25 minutes or so. The doctors tried several anti-spasmodics which would work for a period, then not at all. I began keeping a log of everything I ate at the recommendation of my psychologist. Over time I learned some of the triggers, such as crowds, waiting in lines, dating, movies, and many many foods - all were removed from my life. I basically became a hermit and found even getting to work difficult. I take imodium daily (under doctor supervision) but sometimes that still does not work. If I want to go to a musical or concert, my only recourse is to not eat for 2 days before the event.

794,"Thank you to everyone who was willing to share their storiy. They gave me the courage to contribute here. I am a 46 year old male and I have suffered from chronic constipation since early childhood and the cause is not mysterious. I was born with a neurogenic bowel and bladder defect so bowel function has never been normal for me. My chlldhood was filled with painful enemas. But what is most depressing for me right now is that I have to regularly disimpact my rectum of hard, dry, stool. It is just that bad and needless to say it does not make me feel very good about myself. I certainly do not feell very 'sexy'. While I could elaborate on endless details about my how this has affected my life I will just summarize by saying that in addition to the physical discomfort an never ending malaise caused by chronic constipation, I feel that the 'social' costs have been the most bothersome. This begins with the observation that there is basically noone to talk to about this problem simply because noone really wants to discuss it. Physicians are quite dismissive and will just give you the standard recommendations of more water, fiber, exrcise, etc. None of these things have ever had a noticable impact on my situation. There is no 'remedy' for someone with nerve damage. Its likely that most physicians have no idea what its like to live day to day and be this constipated. The fact is that I feel really different than other people and not able to take care of yourelf in a very basic way. I find this very alienating, My wife is very suportive but that dosen't seem to help how I feel. Unless by some miracle I happen to meet someone on this site (frankly, I can't imagine how we would ever 'connect') I am likely to keep feeling pretty lonely. And yes...I've been to therapy. I've been going for years. At least this forum seems like a step in the right direction. I have essentially remained chronically constipated by default since lack of normal nerves and poor bowel control when combined with laxitives, too much fiber, medications, etc. just cause too much unpredicatbiltiy for me. I simply do not have enough time to get to the toilet in the case of an emergency and since I have never had any kind of bowel schedule, I never know how and hen my body will react. Sometimes I am afraid of accidents or not being near a toilet so I just cancel plans or have a tendancy to stay home way more than I would if I didn't have this problem, It seems as though plenty of people in this forum suffer this dilemma as well. It seems that I only have the choice of these two extremes: unbelievable constipation requiring manual disimpaction or unpredictable gas, cramps and loss of control leading to an accident. For these reasons, having a bowel problem causes me a lot of complicated feelings. When it comes right down to it, I really don't want to discuss this topic at all. However, as sufferers on this forum would know, I NEED to talk about it. But mainly, there is noone to talk about it with anyway. For me, these are the social complexities related to having a bowel problem. I'm not sure I will ever feel that mentally comfortable with any of it. And I feel like I've really tried. I really know how it is and my compassion goes out to everyone on this forum.",,forum,forum,constipation,people,accident,toilet,medication,loss,cramp,gas

797,"Gastroparesis the beginning. I believe my journey began in 1989 with the first migraine, but I didn't realize it. The first migraine I had was a reaction to Indocin. I thought, at the time! And it may very well have been! What you also need to know? Is that I was an avid exerciser, biker, jogger, and really worked at being healthy. Always had sinus and constipation issues but did my best to get around those without slowing down and you would not see me near a doctors office~~ until it interfered with my life! Which one winter it did with pleurisy... My Dr just shook his head, when I said, "" I can't run... Because it hurts to breathe,!"" And he says, "" well yeah!"" One thing which might help to understand my personal tenacity? Is to know, I was hit straight in the driver's side door in 1990. I was leaving an observation of elementary school to then drive two hours for exams towards the end of a semester, to finish a degree in early childhood education! My car was totaled, my tooth knocked out, lower front jar broken, muscles pulled from back of my neck, and all I could think of was ""this is not! Happening right now! I am finishing this degree!"" I would get my mouth wired, go home, return to the hospital with concussion symptoms and AGGRAVATED! But would return to my classes in a neck brace. Okay, so fast forward to many years later and I begin to have non- stop stomach viruses. They were also linked to a period of time with massive migraines, sinus polyps, walking pneumonia, two sinus surgeries, allergies, and then the hunt began. 1996 I had a hysterectomy and appendectomy because of repetitive ovarian cysts bursting and forming with endometriosis. Along with the ongoing -unrelenting GI issues. Things would calm for a period of time. Then I would go into fight to keep my job to only lose it again with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain recurring again with bouts of constipation. The dehydration and migraines with a merry- go- round of symptoms hiding themselves from the normal tests made diagnosis difficult back in 1996 - 1998. I would be fired from my teaching job... Get another job .. Then be fired from it while in a hospital bed. Then while in the gastroenterologist Merry-go-round ... a precious Doctor told me ... ""I am referring you to a motility specialist."" I immediately asked him, "" do you think I am crazy? What kind of doctor is that?"" Because to be honest, this was getting a little crazy and at this point, I had never heard of a motility specialist! 1999 He reassured me and this phase of my journey would lead me to Dr Thomas Abell ... Thank God! Who removed the question marks and got everything stabilized enough to do testing and begin the diagnostic phase. The answers weren't easy.. But the point of this whole story is ... I would not have found out, I had gastroparesis, a paralyzed colon ( pseudo-obstruction) , received help for these migraines ( abdominal based) and went on to peel back the layers of sjogrens and mitochondrial malabsorption disorder.... Neuropathy. ( i probably left something out ... I live in a semi- state of denial) The first set of doctors were the ""best"" but clueless! The second tried, but referred me, and that led me to the ""third time is blessed! "" The third attempt I was blessed enough to meet a Doctor who had trained under Dr Thomas Abell! 2000 He would go on to send me to South Carolina and Dr Lahr and have a colectomy - which changed life measurably. Did not change the facts, but made it less miserable! So, from a diagnosis in 1999 to today trying to stay alive~~~ the theme is persevere one moment at a time. Doing what is necessary is not easy, nor do we always have the strength to do so, but it is better to go forward .. No matter how tedious or difficult! So, on this synopsis of a journey which did not accept the gastric electrical stimulator, I have gone through a PICC line placement from 1999 - 2005, port-a-cath placements from 2005 - present. ( on fifth port) I celebrate today, but pray for a better tomorrow and research with diagnosis codes which allows for treatment without hearing "" we know you need this, but because others have messed up - we have limits which have been put on us"" Then you ration your meds.., and the insurance company decides not to pay for an item which meets the criteria for which they are basing their denial!

801,After 50 years of dealing with IBS may I suggest the following: What to do when IBS attacks in rush hour traffic. Prepare an emergency toilet kit and place it in your car. Some people include clean underware and pants. Emergency toilet kit Metal bed pan with absorbent bed pan liners (Walmart) 2 bed pads (doggie pee pads work well) TP and a small package of baby wipes or adult wipes Small hand sanitizer Small air freshener 1 small trash can liner Procedure: 1. Pull off the road to a safe and private spot. Turn off the car and apply the break. 2. Grab your emergency car toilet kit and move your car seat back. +This is a good time to ask passengers to “take a short walk” if the area is safe. 3. Place one absorbent bed pad on the seat and backrest to aid in clean up. 4. Position your pre-lined bed pan against the back of the seat. 5. Slide down pants and underware and sit on the bed pan. 6. Cover yourself with the second absorbent bed pad 7. Relieve yourself and wait for the absorbent material to control liquid 8. Wipe as needed with TP and wipes. 9. Slide the bedpan to passenger seat and return clothes to their normal position while covered with the bed pad. 10. Roll absorbent materials and place in a small trash bag for disposal. 11. Clean your hands with sanitizer wipes. Spritz car lightly with air freshener or air out the car before passengers re-enter. 12. Dispose of soiled materials and refresh your emergency car toilet kit when you go home. For good psychological health remember that this happens to thousands of people every day.

(overwhelming comatose feeling) earlier last yr at a friends wedding i collapsed in the toilets in agony in my lower left side of my stomach, i awoke to be told i had a stoke (ischemic colitis) and provided infection didn't set in ,and kill me ,i would be left with ongoing complications! ( shock to me this is not ibs!!).my bowel isnt moving as it should ,causing constipation. since then i am terrified they are unable to find the cause of lack of movement and i have been in hospital multiple times dehydrated. they rehydrate me and off i go again. has anyone else experienced this?? i am told it is very rare , i am only 42 and this is an exhausting scary condition.",,pain,energy,condition,tale,hydrate,constipation,infection,colitis,stomach,side
803,"Hi My name is April!!! I am so excited to share my story! Omg first and foremost to everyone living with this God awful disease Gastroparesis I love you and I am praying for you constantly! Well I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was pregnant with my youngest son! Horrible at keeping my levels under control thinking ir was a game! Well in 2010 I had my first set of symptoms and didn't know! I was at work and I started hurting and vomiting everywhere o was rushed to the ER they made me eat some God awful radioactive eggs! Then I had to just wait! They never told me what was going on I got better and never thought about it again! Then in May of 2012 I was at work again, stomach started hurting again, this time I had to eat radioactive oatmeal!! Again God awful! Well this time I had to resign from my job bc I wasn't getting better! I have DOUBLE Ds!!! When I say they went down to A CUPs I knew it was a problem! I started at 142 ended up at 93! 50 lbs within 3 months! I wanted to die! Every time I would go to the ER they would think I'm addicted to pain mess but let's keep it real u guys know that's all we really have to make it go away! I saw dr after dr! Then we decided to get the stimulator! 60,000 might I add! Well insurance paid of course! Only 20.00 bucks opp! My surgeon who was 300 miles away had the remote and he has to keep tweeting it over a course of months! That still really didn't work! My family put me in the behavior health bc I wanted to die!!! I couldn't recognize myself and the pain was unbearable! I would make myself vomit to get relief! My kids cried constantly! Well my fiancé (the greatest most patient man on Earth) pushed me into caring again! We started doing our own research! So I noticed I would really only have flare ups when I'm about to have a period! So Gastroparesis also makes women have endometriosis! So we figured if we could maybe stop the pain we could maybe relieve some symptoms! So I asked my Dr to put me on Depo Prevera saying that that could kill 2 birds with 1 stone! No more periods and I heard it makes u gain weight! Omg I promise on my life it started working almost instantly! I took the shot the beginning of July I started feeling better within a few weeks! Well of course you have to take the shot every three months and I forgot! I had been good the whole 3 months then around October I got sick again! Had to take a 3 week loa from my job that I had just started 7/7! So my dr put me back on the shot I got better within a few weeks and I have been taking my shots and feeling healthy and living my life again!!!  I'm currently 146! I know everyone isn't the same but if this could just help 1 person I would be a happy soul! I don't wish this pain on my enemy!! Hope u enjoyed!",,doctor,doctor,job,pain,God,radioactive,health,opponent,kid,boyfriend
804,"Many of the great notables of our day would defend the widely used verb-age we all know is true ""knowledge is power"", even scripture teaches us this. I have had to force myself to make drastic changes in lifestyle and diet, including staying informed and realizing ""I am my best advocate"". Even Hippocrates stated ""all diseases begin in the gut""...I armed myself with this knowledge and went head long into my Dr's office ready to share what I've been researching...Her words were not only shocking but self-deflating as well. She replied as if speaking to a 5yo child ""stop reading things on the internet"". I nearly walked out on the spot but right now for various reasons, I need her. If Hippocrates realized such simplicity then why are so many GP's clueless as to how to treat this disease?. I've been raging war with my gut since age 15. Many episodes left me paralyzed to go anywhere or eat anything and it is humiliating and embarrassing and emotional, tears welling up from all the pain and unknown's...coming from all fronts and just about every area of my life has been affected greatly from friends, loved ones, Dr's, potential dates and even opportunities to travel and fulfill my dream of college. It is so frustrating to the core when u are a motivated, organized well put together person only to watch from chair-side or bed while in excruciating pain, your eyes slowly rolling over your environment which isn't fit for anyone to visit, and in no way I would care to be living in, witnessing first hand and slowly forcing the acceptance that your life has drastically changed and is crumbling all around you. I have tried all avenues, seen all kinds of Dr's, had all kinds of test' done and still no clear reason why such horrible pain and discomfort has plagued me all these years. For months I was confined to lying down on my back as this was the only position I could get any real measure of relief from my constant pain and bloated discomfort, which in turn, makes your muscles softer and weaker and less muscle mass/tone will be the result. People look at me and say, ""well-you don't look sick""...how does one respond to that? Lately, I learned to say, ""Oh, it's okay"" but without a doubt my biggest frustration is with my Dr's who want to keep passing the buck and pawing me off to some other Dr to figure things out. I have read numerous articles on ""Leaky Gut"" and would like to share with you all that this could be a good starting off point for your researching about how to heal the gut, but be forewarned, most Dr's will laugh or say ""what is that""...Colostrum capsules are a supplement that has properties that will heal a leaky gut, seal up your intestines so your body will be better able to perform...your absorption levels will increase and you will begin to take in nutrients...but, as a firm believer in this product, no healing can begin in the gut unless your first close up the holes...GP's don't know jack about this, ""leaky gut syndrome""..so do your homework and study like Hippocrates say's...healing begins in the gut! I suffer from IBS-C...i have gone days, as much as an entire week without evacuation. I was hooked on laxatives for months suffering in agonizing pain. I tried to walk but couldn't bc the pain was so unbearable and i felt like I was carrying lead bricks. Spasms, Bloating, Cramps, Gas that never seems to want to get out of me, nauseated most all the time, poor appetite, depression, and anxiety...panic attacks from Hell! And Dr's glare at you like a deer in the headlights, or dazed and confused like your speaking some foreign language. I believe it must be in our water/food/packaging or possible even microwave use...these are all areas worthy of exploring. Something somewhere is causing people to be sick. Remember, You are your own best advocate!

805,"I am dependant on enemas. Will be 63 soon ,have used them for about 35 yrs. I had developed hemroids, had been ill ,not eating ,when I started eating, I had hard stool and forced some bowel movements. A visiting doctor gave me a bottle of powder ( can't remember the name, but it increases bulk) and I took it. Of course my constipation got worse and my hemroids became horrible , I couldn't leave the house because I couldn't sit properly.I refused to go back to that Dr.or any other, until I could see my reg guy . Decided to use an enema to get some relief , it worked and there was very little pain. I was sold !!! Used every day for almost a year. Finally got ""DOC"" back and of course he fussed me out and cussed the Dr. Who gave me the powered fiber. He gave me the lecture about how to stop the constipation and I got some relief. Didn't even need surgery for the hemroids. A year later he was forced to retire(at 70) His wife was severely ill. I had bouts of constipation and decided I wanted no pain and be able to get up , relieve myself , get on with life. Used enema every morn before work so I wouldn't have to go at work and I didn't have gas or pain or bloating. Now at my age , I HAVE to have them. If I don't use them . I am miserable all day. But I've had diverticulitis for several years. I had a pancreatic incident . No Dr. Could tell me why, surgery removed a blockage in my bowels and I recovered,spent 3 weeks in hospital where they used enemas so I wouldn't strain. Although I ate almost nothing for over s month, they did enemas anyway. I had another attract of my pancreas (it hates me)but antibiotics worked( I went as soon as I felt the pain) I would love to get off enemas, but I've tried all the laxatives( cause nausea) tried the yogurts that suppose to help(nausea)..My late husband would have coffee in the A.M. and head straight to the ""library"". A long haul trucker,you would think he'd have trouble going, but even when COPD put him on heavy med's. Reg as clock work , and yes I did try coffee , just got indigestion ... Only plus to all this , I haven't had hemroids again. But PLeASE don't take that as an endorsement, my life would be so much better without this dependence. No trip or vacation, even taking the grandson to the pool or movies is a trial. If I can't have privacy , I can't use my enema and it's ruined many a vacation",,doctor,doctor,pain,constipation,nausea,coffee,husband,surgery,snooker,grandson

807,"In March, 2015 I became ill with symptoms that were flu-like and resulted in aches and pains, and a fever. After a couple of days my bowel movements stopped and gas pressure and bloating became acute. I went to the ER and they did a cat scan, which showed an intestinal blockage. The Dr. said was that the blockage was caused by adhesions that had formed near the Ileum from my appendicitis operation 45 years ago. What I thought was IBS (and I recall now that the symptoms started shortly after my appendix was removed) was actually a constriction. Every few days I’d go through a cycle of constipation followed by diarrhea, sometimes mild, sometimes extreme. I could feel the pressure build up, then the contents would sit there for a while and soften until it was able to get through the point of constriction. Following surgery to release the adhesions, my IBS symptoms have completely cleared up and bowel movements are normal again. This caused me to wonder if there are other cases of misdiagnosed IBS for those who have had appendicitis or other abdominal surgery that has caused the formation of adhesions.",,adhesion,adhesion,surgery,appendicitis,acute,cat,scan,doctor,doctor,gas
808,"I have been dealing with ""undiagnosed"" digestive issues since I was 25. I have spent a majority of my 20's and now the beginning of my 30's suffering and living a life controlled by digestive motility disorders. It all started with not being able to go to the bathroom for weeks at a time, nausea, noticeable and uncomfortable bloating (look pregnant/clothes not fitting), painful stomach cramping, chest pains and gurgling/trapped air in chest (unable to burp), weight gain, and increased stress and depression levels. It has ruined events and vacations, my attendance at work, my self-esteem and has been the cause of many sleepless nights. Needless to say I have gained a really good relationship with my heating pad. After doctor after doctor, specialist after specialst, having every procedure/test/x-ray imaginable, trying all sorts of diets and food restrictions, doing physical therapy and many trials of medications I was being told I just had IBS-C and Acid Reflux. I knew there was something more serious going on with me so I kept pushing on with more doctors and more tests. They eventually diagnosed me as having weak peristaltic function of the esophagus (which explains the pains/gurgling/trapped air in chest and inability to burp) and a small/normal sized anterior rectocele (which was caused by all the years I have been straining). Neither of these explained why I was suffering from the other more serious issues I was having. They were actually more less issues I was having as a result of the more serious things that were going on in my body. At one point I had to actually ask to have a colonoscopy (yep I asked for one that is how bad I was suffering!) During the colonoscopy they could not even finish it. My large intestine was so long and loopy that they called it a ""tortuous colon"". And since they could not finish it that meant more tests in order to check the rest of it that they could not get through. I thought finally they figured it out and I could finally get this taken care of. That was until the doctor told me there was nothing they could do for me and there was NO surgery to fix it. I was devastated. After much research I found that there were surgeries for dysfunctional colons and started to reach out to colon surgeons instead of GI doctors. I then started to be told that a total colectomy surgery could be the answer but that the surgery is frowned upon in younger adults. One surgeon wanted to give me a temporary colostomy bag to test motility before removing my large intestine despite all the testing I already had done showing the motility was abnormal. This would have consisted of 3 or more surgeries in a row. This made me weary as I was always under the impression that surgery was to fix things not diagnose things. That surgeon also told me there was no other testing that I could have and the colostomy bag would be the only way to know for sure (I learned later that they were wrong and I was right to follow my instinct not to move forward with them). Another colon surgeon told me that the colostomy bag was not necessary based on my test results (I soon learned later that he was correct). His diagnosis was: ""I believe that we have established that your colon motility is markedly abnormal based on the results of your Sitz marker study. Evaluation of your small bowel motility was the 24 hour Sitz marker image ""“ yours shows all the markers in you colon by that time, as would be expected with normal small bowel motility. The evaluation that you have had was appropriate and thorough to rule out pelvic floor/neurologic abnormalities that can be the primary source of abnormal colonic transit, such as short segment Hirschsprung's disease, a large rectocele, or pelvic dyssynergia. Although you have a small rectocele, I agree that this is not the source of your problem. The other tests results (positive rectal anal inhibitory reflex, adequate balloon expulsion test, normal defecography) have essentially ruled out these other causes of constipation."" I was stressed on the edge of deciding if I should move forward with surgery why doctors kept giving me mixed messages. No one could even give me a name for my condition and the surgeons were disagreeing on how my surgery should be done. I was hitting dead end after dead end with doctors (still accumulating the expenses). How was one to decide on such a major surgery with so many doctors disagreeing if it would work? I kept asking my Mom to pull some strings in heaven and send me a sign on what I should do. I was starting to feel depression setting in even more. Looking for feedback from others suffering with motility disorders I found a site http://www.inspire.com/groups/agmd-gi-motility/ and got a response from a woman named Marcia who told me there WERE other tests out there and that there are doctors who specialize in motility disorders like mine. She gave me the name and contact information of a doctor telling me ""you have to see him!!"" I listened to her and sent my story to Dr. Camilleri at the Mayo Clinic in MN. Not only did he respond but he also got me on his waitlist as he felt there were still tests that needed to be done before I moved forward with surgery! He was quite upset that anyone would tell me that I would need 3 surgeries and a colostomy bag to test motility! I traveled to Mayo and stayed there a week where I met with Dr. Camilleri and had a full 48 hour slow transit study, an EKG, more blood work and a colonic manometry done. Based on my medical records, past test/procedures results and his findings I finally got answers! The verdict....... My right side of my large intestine was slow and backing up into my small intestine. The pacemaker cells on that side were obviously not working. They referred to this as slow transit. I did not have IBS or SIBO! The issues I was experiencing were due to the issues with the abnormal, dieing colon! My colon was VERY long, loopy and tortuous as previously discovered. During the UN-SEDATED colonic manometry procedure they had the same trouble the doctors in the past had with my colonoscopy. To the point they had to do it twice and it hurt like hell! There was still some contraction going on in my colon when given a small meal and when given iv medication so before moving forward with surgery I was put on a one month trial of Resolor (which had to be shipped from the UK through a Canadian pharmacy so insurance would not cover it and I had to pay $150 a script out of pocket for it). Despite being done with medication Dr. Camilleri's reasoning for trying the medication and based on my colonic manometry results I agreed to try it. Unfortunately my body did not react positively to it and made me sicker. We even tried Resolor with Miralax and still nothing (literally). Dr. Camilleri was shocked and knew he had his answer! At this point Dr. Camilleri felt I had tried everything and I moved forward with scheduling my laparoscopic colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis surgery at the Mayo Clinic - Rochester Methodist Hospital in MN. I had to travel 7 - 8 hours there and back just for a surgery consultation with Dr. Cima who is the surgeon that Dr. Camilleri had referred me to. Dr. Cima agreed to do the surgery. He felt that I was a good candidate for a successful surgery because my pelvic floor and rectum muscles are still working and are strong. And my small intestine was still functioning. The good thing about the ton of procedures I had went through is that I knew everything was in working order which helps to avoid as many post op complications as possible. Once the large intestine is gone.. its gone! ************ UPDATED SUMMARY SINCE SURGERY ************ * January 18th, 2013 - I had a laparoscopic colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis surgery done by Dr. Cima at Rochester Methodist Hospital (Mayo). The surgery went well and they removed 10 ft of large intestine (a normal one is 5 ft). The surgeons kept telling me ""it was VERY VERY long"" as if they had never seen one so long before. I was in the hospital for 8 days due to complications. I was throwing up every day until I was given an NG tube. They said my small bowel was taking its time to wake up. I was released from the hospital on Jan 25th. * January 27th, 2013 - I was rushed back into Mayo by ambulance (thank god we hadn't got on our flight home yet) and was re-admitted. I was in massive amounts of pain to the point the paramedics had to pick me up off the hotel bathroom floor and I was having panic attacks . Apparently I had formed a blockage. They told me there was a twist in my small intestine near the anastomosis site that was ""flopping over blocking the rectum"". They also discovered a blood clot in my liver that formed during surgery that they had no idea was there. At the hospital the pain was so unbearable I was in tears and screaming in pain. My husband, Frank even told the nurses ""my wife is a tough woman.. if she is in this much pain something is seriously wrong!!"". After ALOT of morphine/dilaudid, another NG tube, CT scans, xrays, a sigmoidoscopy with balloon dilation, a decompression tube and alot of monitoring I was finally released on Feb 5th and after almost a month in Minnesota we were able to fly home. My large intestine was sent to pathology and I asked for it to be donated for research at Mayo so they can get a better handle as to why this is happening in some people. They found there were barely any nerves left in the lining of my large intestine!! It really was DEAD! They even sent me a photo (see it in my updates). Now I have proof that it wasn't ""just IBS"" or that I was not crazy and something was seriously wrong!! * February 26, 2013 - I was rushed to my local Silvercross Hospital ER in Illinois. After weeks of very painful cramping my bowel movements started to slow down drastically. Each time I was concerned I would contact Dr. Cima and his staff who would tell me this was the normal surgery healing process and not to be alarmed. Before I knew it I had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, was noticeably bloated and in more pain. I decided to contact Dr. Camilleri who instructed me to go to my local ER. I am glad that I did. The blockage came back with a vengeance. In a sense it never left. The doctors as Silvercross explained to me that the first blockage I got may have been due to the flopped over twisted section of the small intestine blocking my rectum however the twist was still there and would continue to cause me problems. The twist was the way my small bowl naturally curved when the surgeons connected it to my rectum. However it was a 360 degree twist right before the anastomosis. When the doctors at Mayo cleared the blockage with the balloon dilation the twist moved away from the rectum and opened up but it formed a crease where it had flopped over. So then my body tried to heal the crease and in the process was closing up the anastomosis connection. A GI doctor at Silver Cross tried the less evasive approach to see if another sigmoidoscopy/balloon dilation would open up the anastomosis connection but it was to the point it was pretty much almost completely healed shut and the procedure only lead me to more massive amounts of pain and the tubes were removed immediately. By then it was more days of no bowel movements and my small intestine was becoming inflamed and the pain was getting worse. I was put back on a morphine drip to make me ""comfortable"". It came down to it that another surgery was the only way to fix it. I was given Dr. Bass who was a wonderful surgeon. On March 2nd, he went in to do laproscopic surgery but ended up having to do ""open"" surgery to be able to see and fix things correctly. He removed the twisted area of the small intestine as well as the original anastomosis connection that was closing shut. He then created a new anastomosis connection that flows with my body and has a larger diameter. The small bowel no longer twists as it connects to the rectum. It now flows with the correct curvature to allow bowel movements to flow the way they are suppose to with less chance of a recurring blockage. In a sense he fixed my plumbing :) He also removed a small cyst on my right fallopian tube while he was in there that I was not aware of. I was released to start my recovery process all over again on the evening of March 6th. To say the least I was mentally and physically put through the ringer. I have even had quite a few mental breakdowns of depression during my recovery process but I pulled through. Since then I have been dealing with post operative sporadic chest pain attacks that they think could be bile reflux.They cause me to miss days at work and leave me incapable of doing anything when they happen. They feel like a heart attack and are incredibly scary. The day after it feels like someone had punched me in my chest and it takes me a few days to finally feel normal again. * June 12th, 2014 - I was rushed to the ER at Silvercross again. I was having a chest pain attack that was worse then any of the ones I have had since my surgery. It shot across my chest and even down my back. After blood work, xrays, ultrasounds and gi cocktails they discovered I had pancreatitis and gallstones. I am on medication for nausea, spasmatic pain and anxiety (as needed).I have scheduled an ERCP with Dr. Ayub and gallbladder removal surgery with Dr. Bass. I have re-set my GoFundMe goal to reflect the new upcoming struggles. * July 15, 2014 - Went into the hospital to have my outpatient ERCP done by Dr. Ayub. He went in and cleaned out my bile and pancreas ducts and got all the gallstones out of them. He also put in 2 metal stents. One for the bile duct and one for the pancreas. What was suppose to be outpatient landed me hospitalized for 5 days. At first they wanted to keep me to monitor me overnight because I was having trouble waking from anesthesia. Then when I finally woke up I was in a lot of pain. My pancreas became inflammed from the procedure and I formed pancreatitis again. The stents were also causing me additional sharp shooting pains in my side. I was released to go home on July 19, 2014. * August 1, 2014 - I had my surgery to have my gallbladder removed. Dr. Bass was able to do it laproscopicly. He said that the surgery went well and that when he took my gallbladder out it was distended and larger then a normal size gallbladder. He is confident that the gallbladder has been causing my chest pain attacks for the past year. I was released to go home and was doing great until about 1am. I went to lay down in bed and was in so much pain I could not move. This was not typical incision pain or discomfort. Frank had to rush me to the ER. I was admitted back into the hospital for pain management and monitoring. Apparently I was experiencing muscle spasms as well as ileus (my bowels were not waking up fast enough). I was released to go home a few days later. I was on more unpaid medical leave to recover. My digestive system is trying to adjust to not having a gallbladder on top of already not having a large intestine. I am scheduled to have my stents removed on Sept. 9th, 2014. It has been quite the journey and I am still dealing with my set backs but I am happy and grateful that I moved forward with my surgery. I actually forgot what it felt like to be empty even if it means being a little more empty then the average person and I thank my lucky stars there was an answer for me even if I had to be the one to push the doctors in the right direction. I do not experience CONSTANT stomach aches, bloating to the point of looking pregnant, my clothes fit and are actually too big on me and for the first time in 8 years can go to the bathroom. I do have to live differently as I am now missing parts of my digestive track and it does have it's set backs but not the set backs I was facing before. It's not an easy recovery process and the complications have been scary as hell but it has been worth it. I also know that had I given up and not tried over and over again to finally get a diagnosis I would have ended up on the ER table having this surgery done on me anyways (and hopefully the right one). So for those still looking for answers don't be discouraged by my journey! Keep looking for answers and don't let any doctor tell you it's ""just IBS and heartburn"". That's what they told me and now I am living with no large intestine and no gallbladder because they were not functioning correctly! If you feel it is something more then that get another opinion until someone does something about it!

811,"My story started around 2008 and it took 6 years to get a correct diagnosis for my Gastroparesis. My health issues all started when I was working with a family member. First my blood pressure went sky high, then I started having stress and anxiety problems. A few years before this all started I was using some cleaning fluid to remove spots from some clothes, not thinking about breathing in fumes from the cleaner while working in my small laundry room. I could not eat because I got so full so fast and I was short of breath and of course that caused panic attacks. I dropped 35 lbs in less than 6 months, which I was glad to lose the weight but not the way I did. That started my journey to find a doctor or doctors who could or may help me. I was told I had damaged my airways and so was put on meds for asthma and other sort of breathing meds. They helped some but then it just seem to get worse. I had an upper and lower scope, twice on the upper, was told they didn't see anything wrong. I never had a problem of throwing up but I would feel nauseous. Was told to stay away from oranges, tomatoes, onions, all citrus type of foods. Oh was told I had GERD. One doc even put me on IBS meds which just about killed me. Finally after years of research, going to doctor after doctor, a friend had me go see her Gastro doctor and he did a stomach emptying test. That is when I found out what disease I had. It is an awful disease and I hate it everyday. Low residue diet is how I am suppose to eat, everything white, no raw fruits or veggies, nothing that is good for me. Anyway I have been taking medicine for about 6 months and the first one was one that could cause Parkinson disease or cause your head to freeze to one side. Told doc do not want to take that med so he switched me over to a med I have to get compounded and insurance doesn't pay so it cost me $92.00 per month. WOW and on a SS check at that. Anyway this med is not really helping, but the doctor said there is no cure and will just have to live with it. Easy to say when you don't have the disease, but you know there is always someone worse off than you are. I think this way to get through the day. I have eyes to see, ears to hear, legs to walk and arms to love people with. I have a home and family and friends who love me. Now all I need is for someone to find a cure or something that really works on this awful disease. Good luck to all you dealing with what I have and may God Bless and Comfort you.",,disease,doctor,doctor,kind,breathe,.doc,friend,fruit,drug,white
812,"I have dealt with constipations as long as I can remember. I am now 65 in good health apart from the fact that now I have diarrhea that can happen anytime anywhere. My husband and I moved to OK 1 year ago from CA. 2 months ago I was in a Belk Department store looking for a gift for my grand daughter and I knew I was going to loose control of my bowels. The ladies bathroom room was at the other end of the building and I was in much stress. I ran to the ladies changing room and lost control. I told a sales girl, but could not wait around to explain and ran out and drove home. 2 weeks later I get a letter form Owasso court telling me that the store has charged me.

814,"About 7 years ago I was so sick, I looked like I was ready to have triplets. I was in terrible pain, was nautious and vomiting. I went to my GI and he started performing all these test. Then one day I was asked to bring two pieces of buttered toast for my next test, they provided the hard boil egg that had some kind of mechanism in it where the tech could take pictures every 15 minutes for two hours and actually see where the egg was moving through my digestive system. Well the egg did not move. About 3 weeks after that I got very sick I was vomiting all the time, very nautious and extremely weak. The doctor put me on probiotics and promethazine tabs to help the vomiting and nausea. The only problem was I bringing up the medicine. So we went to shots of promethizine, I believe I did this for 2 years and my skin on my back side looked like someone put cigarettes out on it. My doctor put me on IV promethizine because my vomiting and nausea were still and every day occurrence, at least 3 times a day, in addition he put me on IV fluids because I was dehydrated. For the past 6.90 years I have living on liquids (home made healthy smoothies) and I have just tried spoonfuls of yogurt. I have lost over 70 pounds and I need help fast, I am very sick.

818,"Since I was in high school I had developed IBS-D (diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome). Fortunately I do not consider myself to have a chronic but frequent flare-ups of diarrhoea. It has been sort of a nightmare with me as I have had many embarrassing public diarrhoea accidents as one of the 'perks' of this disorder. Some of my more most embarrassing were my accident in Paris at the ticket counter of the Gare de Lyon. It was also a hot summer day and I was wearing shorts as well.  I was caught off guard as most of these accidents were, and as I had a small accident in queue, I left the queue and tried to find the 'hommes' (Yes, I am 25yo Japanese-Swiss male). I went across the main concourse and spotted the men's loo. I made a mad dash towards it. en route another 'wave' hit me and this disgusting lava had spilled a trail behind me all over this concourse as I was making for the loo. That was embarrassing of course.  Then whilst on a visit with a friend in Sušice, in Czech Republic, as I was leaving and on this bus (an old Soviet Era intercity bus with NO lo!) again in early Autumn I was wearing short pants and had only one change of clothes, a faded pair of levis. En route to Praha (Prague) I hadnearly had an accident in my shorts on that bus and I begged the driver to pull over so I could get off and take care of personal business. As I was starting to let loose in the stepwell, he reacted by capitulating and pulling over. I got off and made a mess on the shoulder. I got back in with soiled clothing and as these old busses had no luggage hold I had my luggage on board with me. I got out my only other pair of pants a faded pair of Levi jeans. I put these on despite the bad odour and being still soiled, and before we got into Prague, I had another 'wave' to contend with.  This time I got off the bus again and managed to spare my last pair of (relatively) clean jeans. I cancelled my flight back to France as I was sick in this hotel I booked for a couple of days until I could travel again.  Then this one birthday party in San Francisco where ironically I had a close Chinese friend as professional photographer. We had a Black Russian party as this was my birthday party, and as I rarely consume alcohol, these drinks had gotten to me and as I was (the worst time possible) wearing a pair of white pants well, had an accident in them from all that alcohol. (They were ruined)!  My friend got some professional pictures of my little embarrassment and wanted to make them pubic in his portfolio. I begged him not to make public so he gave me a couple of prints for safe keeping. (Hopefully this won't violate any guidelines here on this website) but I had taken the liberty to publish one of his pictures of my resulting 'back passage' (I have all required permissions as he is a personal friend of mine).  I only do this to give example of the embarrassments I have sustained. Again fortunately these are more on the rare side, but have been known to have happened. (Pictured here is one of my worst accidents). IN actuality, these experiences being not only embarrassing, but have been of course no fun, and now I try to take the route of proper diet to avoid any future episodes.

819,"I am a 27-year-old female. My problems began ten years ago. When I was 17, I had a bowel obstruction. This seemed to happen out of nowhere, and I don't remember having symptoms prior to this. I had no idea what was happening to me, and assumed that my appendix had burst. It was the worst pain I have ever felt. My mother took me to the ER, and I was admitted to the hospital, where I had to undergo emergency surgery. I was very ill, and placed on a lot of pain medication, so a lot of that hospital stay is a blur. I was in the hospital for about one week- I remember the NG tube being one of the worst parts of the whole ordeal! I kept hearing, ""We don't usually see total obstructions in patients your age..."" and it was never determined what caused the blockage. I was given all the usual tests for Crohn's but they were inconclusive. Shortly after healing, I began to have problems with constipation. It was difficult for me to eat regular meals without feeling sick. I had a lot of abdominal pain, sometimes to the point where I had to stay home or miss social events. I would throw up my food. Sometimes it seemed like one meal could immobilize me for three days. I continued to get tests done for almost a year and a half. During this time I took a stool softener which didn't provide nearly enough relief. Eventually, it was discovered that I had another blockage, probably a stricture due to scar tissue from my previous surgery. I scheduled another resection, to take place just after I graduated high school. The ilocecal resection removed part of my terminal ileum and cecum. After a week in the hospital, I was discharged even though I had a fever. It turned out I had an infection, and was readmitted for another week. It was very painful and scary. At the hospital, they inserted a PICC line and I went home with an antibiotic bag, which I kept for 3 additional weeks. This surgery seemed to help me a lot and I felt much more normal after I was all healed up, though now I would have diarrhea instead of constipation. I would have ""Flare ups"" where I'd eat and then immediately have to go to the bathroom, and it would seem like my food was not properly digested. I mentioned this to GI specialists but they did not seem concerned about it. This would happen for a week or two at a time, and then I would feel somewhat normal again. But, I never really knew when these flare-ups would occur. I tried a lot of different diets, including gluten-free, but I could never tell if it made a difference. At age 22 I had a massive episode of GI bleeding, also out of nowhere. I was having a normal day, and suddenly lost so much blood that I felt dizzy. I went to the ER and was admitted to the ICU. Again, I kept hearing, ""We don't usually see GI bleeding in a woman your age..."" I was given many tests, including a colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and capsule endoscopy. I was worried I would need to undergo surgery for a third time. Luckily, this did not happen. However, the doctors were confused as to what caused this bleeding episode, and couldn't find anything in my test results. The closest thing to an ""answer"" I received was that I may have had ulcers in my small intestine that became irritated. When the bleeding resolved, I was sent home after 6 days, and put on Iron supplements and a proton pump inhibitor. I went a solid five years without any more bleeding, but just over the summer, I had another GI bleed. For a few weeks before this, I was experiencing symptoms of peptic ulcers (burning, gnawing feeling in the stomach). I was admitted to this hospital, this time for only 2 days. Once again, doctors offered no explanation to why the bleeding may have happened. As usual, the GI specialist talked to me for about 2 minutes, asked the same questions as everyone else, and then I never saw him again. Once again, I was placed on Iron and a proton pump inhibitor. So, there's my story thus far. I have never been diagnosed with anything other than ""IBS,"" but I feel it must be something more than this because of the obstructions and GI bleeding. I have had every test under the sun, and my results often come back ""normal."" This is good, but it's also frustrating to have no answers. I live in fear that another unexplained medical emergency could happen to me at any time, or that there's something I should be getting treated that I'm not even aware of... In terms of my daily life, I am prone to diarrhea, particularly right after meals (it really depends on the day). I avoid spicy food, fried food and alcohol, and try to eat small portions. I am lucky in the sense that I can maintain a pretty normal life. After ten years, though, I would really like some answers, and I wonder if I will ever get them.

My mom tells me all the time it isn't my fault.. it's true, but hard to face the fact that I will have this forever.

821,"Just finding this site is such a help. I can identify with so many of the stories. Maybe my experience will help others. I am male and 67 years old. I started seeing doctors about my bowel problems, diarrhoea and constipation, nearly 40 years ago. I have heard it all from the docs; it was stress, IBS, but finally, Coeliac disease.  I went gluten-free, and apart from the odd accidental ""glutening"" the problems were much eased for about 10 years. About 25 years ago, it really became chronic constipation. I started taking laxatives frequently, until it became almost daily. Also, the dose had to go up. Eventually, the various doctors prescribed the laxatives, stool softeners and micro-enemas that I need for any kind of bowel movement.  I have had all the issues that you are warned about: bowel pains, anal fissure, inguinal hernia, vomiting, bloating, lack of appetite due to being bunged up etc. About 5 years ago, I had a night-time urinary problem. Tests showed Diabetes, though only just. Then, nearly three years ago, the nurse mentioned that my blood iron was high. Further tests, including a genetic test, showed Haemochromatosis. This is where the gut absorbs too much iron.  I had been a blood donor, and the Coeliac disease reduces iron absorption, so I was diagnosed 10 or 15 years later than the average male. Of course, excess iron in the blood is a well-known cause of constipation, as is diabetes, a gluten-free diet and long-term laxative usage. The treatment is easy enough; I go along to hospital, and they take off a unit of blood, about 450mL here in the UK. I had about 13 of these to get down to an acceptable iron level in 2013, but still need about 8/year now. I'm having one later this morning. It hasn't really helped with the constipation, but should help protect my heart and liver. It's serious.

They said it was non-acid reflux(alkaline) that was seen in the Phtest.He probably had it since he was born but was never diagnosed. He was very colicy as a infant too. We noticed that his voice started getting hoarse when he was 2 years old, but we thought it would get better with time. He's 6 years now and voice got worse. He regurgitates everything he eats to his mouth and swallows it back. He tells me that food came to his mouth about 6-7 times a day. He has no symptoms at night. He gets it when hes standing upright too!! PH probe study showed regurgitation mostly after he eats at daytime. He did'nt have any at night time. I am very concerned about my kid. Will he ever grow out of gerd. Since food comes to his mouth, does it mean he has LPR too? They prescribed Zantac and PPI but I dont see any improvement. Doctor said since he has non-acid reflux,it might not help much but wanted us to try and see if his voice gets better. We dont see any change in regurgitation or hoarseness. He's never complained of stomach pain or heart burn. He has major trouble swallowing...Keeps chewing forever and says theres something stuck in his throat. I am worried that its something that's hereditary as my husband has had GERD lifelong. It started when he was 4 years old and continued all through with similar symptoms as my son.

I am a 30 year old female and the symptoms are only getting more frequent and severe. Sometimes I will be in the bathroom for about an hour in the morning in crippling pain, other times I can be back and forth all morning dealing with the same issue. I'm a teacher, now in my 6th year, and I cannot remember working one year without this issue. To avoid missing my classes at work, I arrive at 6:30 AM. I do not start working until 8:00 AM. I wake up at 4:20 AM to get ready for work and give myself an hour to use the bathroom at home, if needed. I am exhausted from having to plan my life around these terrible symptoms. IBS has made me a very paranoid, panicked, and anxious person. These are the tests and procedures I've had done: 3 endoscopies, 2 colonoscopies, a pillcam procedure, upper and lower GI X-rays, CT scan of the abdominal and pelvic region, uterine ultrasound, pelvic ultrasound, and last-a surgery to check for endometriosis which ended in a small complication, landing me in the hospital for a week and still with no answers. I have been told by every doctor that my insides could not be any healthier in appearance. I have no signs of celiacs, crohns, colitis, or any of those bowel disorders/diseases. I have also done elimination diets, which proved to just make me lose my sanity completely. I am sure most of you with IBS feel the same way: How can pain this intense and severe not be caused by something terrible? I have a hard time myself believing that food causes me this much pain. I barely make it the whole 15 minute ride to work in the morning without having to use the bathroom. Ive called out of work when I was right in front looking for parking because I needed to use the bathroom urgently. I question everything I eat, and then other times I just eat it anyway because I am always suffering regardless of how careful I am. I love work and enjoy what I do but feel like I can't do it to my full potential because of my disability.  Going to NYC, which is 10 minutes from my house is a close to never visit because the traffic makes me doubt if I can actually succeed in getting in and out of the city without needing a bathroom. I wouldn't wish this problem on anyone. It constantly makes you doubt what you can do and you always find yourself creating excuses to avoid situations that you would normally enjoy. I also wake up at an ungodly hour just to use the bathroom before anyone else gets up or walks into work so that I have my privacy and time. The worst part is when employers hear IBS they don't treat it as a serious problem when it is awful. I am currently taking dicyclomine once a day in the morning.

When it is over, I am weak, and it takes me several days to recover. I told this to my new GP during a routine visit, and he informed me he also has it. He prescribed an antispasmodic and told me to take a magnesia product every night to ""keep things moving."" I also take the antispasmodic once a day proactively and as needed during an attack. This has helped lessen the frequency and especially the pain. The antispasmodic medication makes me a bit sleepy, but it is worth it to me to have some relief.

I am apparently one of the 20  per cent of gallbladder cases left with  excessive bile dump into the intestines causing D.  The D became so severe 5 years ago that I underwent a colonoscopy and was told that I had microscopic colitis.  Then I had another colonoscopy in 2014 and the pathology showed no MC. Now I'm told it is IBS-D.  Maybe this is what you are told when the doctor doesn't really know what's going on.  The strange part is I don't have the pain associated with IBS. Just a gushing in my gut after I eat and a lot of times I don't make it to the bathroom in time. I was back to the GI doctor 2 weeks ago after having been up since 3:00 AM with chronic D. I have soiled bedding, carpet and clothing for some 4 years.  I was scared to go to sleep at night fearing an accident. He prescribed Xifaxan for six weeks.  Not sure if anyone here has tried it.  From the first day I took it worked.  I feel almost normal! It's an antibiotic that is absorbed in the intestines. So far, no side effects. Quite expensive - 2 pills per day at about $30/dose.  The long term results of the IBS-D treatment are a little iffy.  It's possible that the symptoms will return and a re-treat will be required.  I'll wait and see.

Had 2 inches below stomach removed doc said I would be on Rolaids the rest of my life. Things went down hill shortly after that first was very bad acid reflex then visits to the ER. Years later removed gallbladder do to extreme nausea and a few years after that more visits to the ER with serious vomiting, Diarria and very bad stomach pain. I was getting very bad gastritis attacks. I have been on all different kinds of acid reflex pills but Prevacid works the best, it sais you should only be on it for a couple of years but I'm going on 28 years now of taking it along with Zantac and 4 other meds for nausia, diarrea, very bad stomach pain and cramps. I have had every possible test and ex-rays done through the years a number of times and have been diagnosed with severe IBS, minor chrons dasiese, gerd and very bad acid reflex. I am now 48 and have been suffering from this for 29 years now and sometimes I can't wait to go to the great kingdom of God but then realize things could be much worse and that this is just my cruch in life and I am here for a reason. The only good thing about this is it keeps my weight normal, anyway people who don't have this have no clue how miserable it is.

831,"When Alex was four days old, we noticed that his breathing was so loud that you could hear it all over the house. and that he had a sunken chest. The pediatrician assured us that he was fine. By the time he was two years old, he was diagnosed with asthma after making many trips to the ER. These visits continued along with hospital admissions throughout the years. Alex was ten years old the first time that he had a problem swallowing. He was in pain and there was frothy saliva coming from his mouth along with mucus. The doctors did an endoscopy. They told us that it was a small plum seed and that his esophagus was inflamed with strictures and he should see a pediatric gastroenterologist. We were referred, and shortly after that he developed an ulceration in his esophagus. That was his first of multiple blood transfusions. He was put on many different medications, we bought him an electric bed to keep his head up all night, and there was one more chronic illness to take care of. It is rare that one is not helped by at least one of these medication. I asked the Allergist if he believed there was a correlation between his asthma and the GERD. ""Of course,"" he said. He told me that if he was a 50-year-old man, he would have known right away. What? Alex eventually had a Laproscopic Nissan Fundoplication, and soon learned that the surgery had failed. It fell apart in three weeks. It was not long before we found another specialist that did the same surgery but open. It was not long before he was not able to swallow at all and he was found to have Barrett's esophagus. He was scheduled for an esophagectomy with a colonic interposition. As usual, I thought this would be it, the answer to our prayers. He did better for about a year, until there were more transfusions, visits to the E.R., stays in the hospital, and endless procedures. They were not able to continue with the endoscopies and Alex was unable to swallow. I was told by his doctor that he needed a PICC line. In his case they were used for TPN. He went through clotting and infections in the lines. Later they put a permanent G-Tube in his stomach to deliver cans of formula. His mental status was failing. Then his doctor told me that Alex was eligible for hospice. I couldn't process that. That couldn't be possible. It was two weeks after that I took Alex to the Emergency Room for the last time. I went to his room to wake him up the next morning. He was cold, his lips were blue and I started CPR and called 911. This time there wasn't an ambulance to race him to the hospital. Instead my house was filled with policemen, firemen and the coroner.",,doctor,doctor,surgery,asthma,home,line,endoscopy,medication,blood transfusion,can
832,"I have IBS (diarrhoea)and this rather nasty 'propensity' of experiencing embarrassing (sometimes explosive) diarrhoea 'incursions'. many times I have worn light coloured (even white painter's pants and have been rather unfortunate to have been at the wrong place and wrong time in encountering these fast acting sudden and most unexpected accidents of the runs in public (not knowing where the nearest loo would be at. Well this was it! Despite the warm winter days, I had gotten an idea. As I live in a suburb, Townsville, I was with my partner en route to Brisbane Airport for a flight to Perth as to visit a mutual friend, when I suddenly had a most embarrassing accident on QR City Train. We got off the next stop Nambour near Brisbane proper and I was one embarrassing mess. So I decided to start as they are so popular anyway to wear black jeans. The trick is that black is least likely to show any spillage in them (only two drawbacks, one is the possibility of odour and secondly, there has been instances that my diarrhoea had been so voluminous that it would trickle out below the leg bottoms and onto the floor or ground by my feet. But it has saved many public spectacles, I must say. So I would definitely recommend wearing black jeans (despite acting like solar heater during winter months, as they go with virtually anything and have become increasingly popular. They are durable and easy to wash. Any mess would be contained and least likely to show publically.",,black,accident,winter,popular,jeans,heater,nasty,heater,heater,spectacle
833,"I was 14 when I was diagnosed with GERD. I was healthy, a varsity soccer player, a straight-A student, and I almost never missed a day of school, until GERD came into my life. I was playing in a soccer game on a hot day, when I had difficultly breathing, chest pain, and I started blacking out. Long story short, I ended up in the ER with heat exhaustion and with orders to rest and get more fluids, and follow up with a doctor about possible asthma. And so begins my journey. I went to an allergist for the possible asthma, but nothing. I developed a chronic cough and would cough so hard I'd throw up. I developed pneumonia and had to sit on the sidelines at my games for weeks. I started missing school, and I had trouble eating. I felt nauseous 24/7 and I lost about 10 pounds in less than a month (and I was super fit!) I became anxious and depressed and I was sick constantly. I was passed from doctor to doctor and specialist to specialist. I was probed and had endoscopies and lots of blood work. Finally I got a diagnosis: GERD. I was excited because I thought I could be treated and that I would get better! I started Nexium, but it didn't work. I tried Prevacid, and it started helping as soon as I got to the max dose. However, I noticed I had less heartburn, but that my nausea wouldn't go away. I was still having breathing problems and I was on steriods, multiple inhalers, motility drugs, and PPIs. I was probed again and it was discovered that I also have non-acidic reflux, so even though the acid is gone, I reflux food and liquids around 90 times a day. I felt like I never got a break. I had swallowing studies and found out that my esophagus had 50% peristalsis, but less than a year later it moved down to 40%. That means I can only move food down my esophagus 4 out of 10 times. Now, 4 years later, eating is still a struggle, but it's gotten better. I made lifestyle changes, and they've helped. But even when I don't eat within 3-4 hours of going to bed, I still wake up almost vomiting 1-2 times a week. I can't get anti-reflux surgery because my esophagus can't push food down well enough even without a tightened LES. It's hard living with a chronic illness, when you look fine (when you don't have probe!), but inside you feel sick constantly. It's hard to do normal things when you feel horrible, but we're strong. We do things that are hard for normal people, but we do it as sick. We live life to the fullest, even when we are in pain. We may not have a terminal illness, but what we have is real. What we have is not a joke, and it is not all in our heads. We may have GI problems, but we have hope!",,flux,food,school,match,breathe,pain,expert,doctor,doctor,asthma
834,"I am 26 and was diagnosed with irritable bowel at the age of 8, it was braught on by severe stress and chronic constipation when my brother was still born. I get constant cramps, day and night and can cry because the pain is so intense, I can go weeks without emptying my bowels and then become the opposite for days/ after. When I do go it can be very painful and take up to an hour. I have three young children and an epileptic husband and my ibs complicates our already stressful life. At school I was severely bullied due to absences and frequent bathroom breaks and anxiety from this put me in years of counselling. I also get hot sweats and severe agonising trapped wind, this is sometimes relived by having a long bath,I have suffered with GERD from birth and was hospitalised for frequent projectile vomiting, this carried on into early childhood, I can remember sat on the carpet at story time and others looking at me and laughing at the noises my stomach made, it is so loud it can be heard by others over the phone, I have very painful, reflux and heartburn and i am often up through the night. I have tried medications and diet control for both but little helps, sometimes I am housebound for weeks at a time due to the anxiety and pain. I can not lie down properly as the reflux is so severe I vomit and have slept propped up since newborn, both conditions have worsened since my pregnancies and especially following my 3rd baby who was born via c-section.

837,"I am losing any positive approach i had for dealing with IBS D. During the first forty plus years of my life i had no bowel issues and was quite regular. In 1985 I had radiation to pelvic area for Cancer of Cervix stage 2, at age 42. Towards the end of the five weeks of radiation i had constant diarrhea even tho not eating much. Long story short, things improved and i went back to work. About ten years later I had a stomach ulcer, and frequent abdominal pain. The dr who did a colonoscopy said worst case of radiation damage, inflammation he had seen for a long time and to watch what i eat. Urologist said my bladder is fried. Had five weeks visible blood in urine 2012. During the next ten years i started to have not only the mystery abdomen pain but started to get bouts of sudden diarrhea. In those days ibs symptoms were bouts of constipation AND diarrhea, and as i only had bouts of diarrhea i didn't pursue ibs. I retired in 2002 and from then until now things have become much worse. A gastroenterologist did another colonoscopy 2008 and said radiation damage healed, take up to eight ........ Pills a day and come back in ten years. It wasnt until 2o15 that my GP trued me on a powder mixed with liquid that i got some relief.  About 25 to fifty percent but unfortunately it made the inside of my mouth so sore i could hardly eat or brush my teeth. Being 72 I have a long story and am trying to condense. Every year sees more pain, more diarrhea and for a few years i have to go to bed the pain is so bad, for days, whether or not i have taken otc meds. On top of it, i have anxiety, depression, lump and right side of thyroid removed, laser to eyes and floaters, and symptoms of fibro and arthritis. Pain clinic could do nothing. Do i feel sorry for myself? On infrequent reasonably good days, no, but frequent days like today and most days, i do and thoughts of not being able to continue cross my mind. I DO try and put it in perspective and think of others worse off, but lately its not working and i feel i am barely hanging on.. I listen to meditation, relaxation cds etc., use hot pad. Have a stack of underwear and cloths. Cant eat anything raw and even cooked veg and fruit. I have tried fodmap diet and it was much worse. My quality of life has gone down the tubes and its affecting my family.. No more trips or vacations. Sorry.

839,"I'm a female in my 40's and I first developed gastrointestinal problems in 2008 after about 3 viral gastro bugs at end of 2007. I first noticed IBS-D when I used to be out exercising daily and I'd have to run back home because I needed the toilet. I'd always be in a panic as the pain was so bad and I'd be worried about the possibility of an accident occurring in public. IBS tends to play up for me in the mornings and usually when I'm trying to get going out the door too which causes a bit of stress for me at times. Also I have what I consider my bad IBS days where I'm in pain with it most of the day, I do have other days where I barely notice it and I consider my bowel is behaving for a change. Since getting IBS, I've developed other gastrointestinal problems too that are quite severe for me. So I've been also been diagnosed with gastrooesophageal reflux disease, oesophageal visceral hypersensitivity, a motility disorder of my oesophagus, sliding hiatal hernia, supra gastric belching, aerophagia. As a result of the reflux and chronic burping I have, I have been diagnosed with 2 voice disorders in January 2013 (although the problem started beginning of 2012) which are reflux laryngitis and muscle tension dysphonia. All of the above things have just made my life a lot more difficult and challenging. It has impacted every area of my life. I've been stared at and laughed at a fair bit. I've had mothers often tell me ""excuse you"" when I'm waiting in queues because they're trying to educate their children that I'm being rude for burping (even though I do so with my mouth closed which hurts me more).  I've learnt to ignore the ignorance of people, but it did get to me at first and sometimes it still does. I obviously don't have the voice to explain myself all the time. I also live with other chronic conditions I need to manage too. So these days rest is very important and I tend to crash every couple of days where I don't function too well and need extra rest.",,flux,pain,disorder,gastric,extra,couple,condition,people,mouth,child
